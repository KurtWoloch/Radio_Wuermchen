You will need to use the openclaw configure command in your terminal to safely update the configuration file.

Get your Anthropic API Key: (I assume you will do this tomorrow).

Run the configuration command:

openclaw configure --section anthropic
# It will prompt you for your Anthropic API key.
Run the model override command:

openclaw configure --section model --set default="anthropic/claude-3-haiku"
# I suggest starting with Haiku as a low-cost, high-performance option.
# You can change to 'anthropic/claude-3-opus' later if needed.
Restart the Gateway: The model change only takes effect after a restart.

openclaw gateway restart
If you want to enable Web Search
If you decide you want web search functionality, you will need to get your Brave Search API key and run this command tomorrow:

openclaw configure --section web
# It will prompt you for the Brave Search API key.
Let's focus on the model change first. Good night!
