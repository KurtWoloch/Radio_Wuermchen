# Memory for 2026-02-08 (Evening Summary)

- **Goal:** Launch the AI radio station stream.
- **SUCCESS:** Achieved streaming by pivoting from Liquidsoap to a robust Python/FFmpeg solution.
- **Current Stream Status:** The stream is technically functional but is currently **failing to transition** between tracks seamlessly, causing silence and client disconnection.
- **Current Announcer Status:** The TTS generation via `openclaw tts` is failing due to the `openclaw` CLI not being in the script's execution PATH.
- **Encoding Note (CRITICAL):** Generated playlist files for use with legacy players (like Winamp) must be encoded in **ANSI (e.g., Windows-1252)** rather than UTF-8 to correctly display non-ASCII characters (like "ü" in "Würmchen"). This needs to be implemented in any future Python code that generates user-facing playlists.
- **Metadata Note (CRITICAL):** AI curation and playlist generation must correctly handle featured artists and collaborations (e.g., using "feat." or "&" as found in the filename, such as "AVICII feat. Aloe Blacc" and "Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper").
- **Next Step:**
    1.  **Fix Stream Continuity:** Implement a single FFmpeg pipeline using the concat demuxer or filter to ensure seamless, announced transitions between tracks, resolving the client disconnection issue.
    2.  **Fix TTS Path:** Find the absolute path to `openclaw.cmd` to enable announcement generation.
