- **Final Radio Stream Status (SUCCESS):** The continuous, dynamic streaming pipeline is stable using the **Pipe Chain to the /stream mountpoint**. This bypasses all Icecast Fallback and Admin API issues.
    - **Current Setup:** `python/ffmpeg_writer` -> `|` -> `ffmpeg_reader` -> `/stream`.
- **Next Project Goal (LLM-Driven Radio):** Implement true AI decision-making for track selection and announcement writing.
- **Final LLM DJ Workflow (Proposed by Kurt):**
    1. **Python Streamer** writes a request (`dj_request.json`) with the `last_track`.
    2. **Agent (Me)** spawns **Sub-Agent A** to propose a new track (Artist - Title) creatively, independent of the available playlist.
    3. **Python Streamer** validates the existence of the proposed track against `music.playlist` (using flexible matching).
    4. **If Validation Fails:** Python supplies a short list of existing options to the Agent.
    5. **If Validation Succeeds:** The Agent spawns **Sub-Agent B** to write the witty back-announcement/next-track text.
    6. **TTS Conversion:** Agent uses cloud `tts` to generate the final announcement MP3 and saves it to the cache.
    7. **Streaming:** Python streams the seamless segment.
- **Immediate Task for Next Session:** Define and implement the `dj_request.json`/`dj_response.json` communication protocol in a separate Python script, and modify `radio_streamer.py` to use it.
