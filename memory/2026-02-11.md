Successfully fixed the radio_streamer.py script to correctly read the DJ agent's JSON response keys ("track_file" and "announcer_mp3_path"), which resolved the Python AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'.
Accidentally deleted the DJ cron job based on stale MEMORY.md information, then successfully restored and re-enabled it.
The final step was cleaning up all verbose console output (sys.stderr.write) from radio_streamer.py to prevent interference with the stable two-FFmpeg pipe chain.
The system is now ready for the user to execute the final, corrected batch command to start the stream upon waking up.
