# Summary of Work - 2026-02-15

**Radio Project (radio-wuermchen):**
*   **DJ Prompting Enhanced:** Integrated current time into `dj_brain.py` system prompt.
*   **Weather Module Complete:** Implemented template-driven scraper (`scraper.py`) for ORF weather, integrated into orchestrator with 30-minute caching. DJ announcements now vary between subtle mentions and full weather reports based on cache age.
*   **News Manager Implemented:** Created `news_manager.py` to scrape ORF main page, parse breaking news, top stories (with URL following), and regular stories. It caches content and tracks presented status.
*   **Orchestrator Overhaul:** Refactored `dj_orchestrator.py` to manage all segments:
    *   Runs news update every 60 minutes for headline bulletins.
    *   Pulls unpresented stories for deep-dive segments between bulletins.
    *   Instructs DJ to suggest a thematically fitting song after news summaries/deep-dives.
    *   Implements time-based announcements (weather/news) and song selection logic.
*   **Bug Fix:** Resolved `AttributeError` in `load_json` helper function by explicitly converting `pathlib.Path` objects to strings before calling string methods (e.g., `.endswith()`).
*   **Project State:** All core changes committed and pushed to GitHub.
