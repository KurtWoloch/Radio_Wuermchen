- Implemented show scheduling system in `dj_orchestrator.py` and `dj_brain.py` to allow time-based overrides for music style, DJ personality, news, and suggestion pools.
- Created 8 new show-specific suggestion pools (e.g., `suggestion_pool_ratpack.txt`, `suggestion_pool_dreaming.txt`).
- Implemented signal locking in `dj_orchestrator.py` by atomically renaming `queue_low.signal` to `.lock` to prevent race conditions from duplicate background processes.
- Updated `tts_generate.py` to implement a 1-hour rate limit cooldown file (`tts_rate_limit.warn`) on Google TTS API failures, falling back to local SAPI TTS if cooldown is active or Google fails for any reason.
