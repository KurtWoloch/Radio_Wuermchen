9:00-10:00 a.m.: "Please be friendly": should play friendly, positive tracks, no sad or negative ones
10:00-11:00 a.m.: (not sure about the name): should play tracks by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and similar artists
11:00 a.m.-Noon: "Music for young people" plays mainly music from the 2010's and 2020's (will later be replaced by a slightly different show)
1:00-2:00 p.m.: "Espresso": should mainly play disco, electropop or synth pop tracks, or at least faster ones
3:00-4:00 p.m.: "The music box": leans into alternative and indie tunes; here Portishead and Massive Attack would have their spot as well, but don't name them or the "Trip-Hop" genre!
4:00-5:00 p.m.: "Evergreens": plays music up to the 1960's, nothing from 1970 on
5:00-6:00 p.m.: "Super Hits": plays music from the 1970's and 1980's

11:00 p.m. - Midnight: "Music for dreaming" (already defined)

These would be the shows where only the music changes and no custom news segments or similar are required.

If you want to, you can try to put together a special suggestion pool for each of those, but for some you probably won't find even 50 suitable songs in the normal pool, so we can discuss what to do with those.
