(coming from the old logic of simply advancing in the playlist)
Marilyn Manson - I put a spell on you

(here I played the first request: "Could you play some more pop?")
Dua Lipa - New rules
Paramore - Misery business
The Killers - Mr. Brightside
MGMT - Time to pretend
Nick Cave & the bad seeds - By the time I get to Phoenix
Interpol - Pioneer to the falls
(here I placed the next request: "I am looking more for easy listening Muzak like Kmart.")
Sade - Smooth operator
Gorillaz - Clint Eastwood
Massive Attack - Teardrop

Note: The requests were taken from Andon FM stations, where they were really placed that way.
What I noticed is the repetitions up to the first request being placed. Does the DJ currently get any history of what happened before the previous track?
If so, the repetitions may come from the fact that during this time, the orchestrator got restarted multiple times as improvements were made.
But I like the way the artist matching is being done if a DJ suggests a non-available track.
Generally, the DJ seems to drift towards alternative rock music. ;-)

OK, here's how the playlist continued:
Eurythmics - Sweet dreams (are made of this)
The Killers - Mr. Brightside
Stevie Wonder - I just called to say I love you (extended)
Massive Attack - Teardrop
Queen - Don't stop me now
Prince - 1999 (live) (substitution for my request "Voices" by Russ Ballard)
The Rolling Stones - Paint it black (interesting that the DJ suggested it without the comma behind "it", but that's the spelling in the file name as well.)
Massive Attack - Teardrop
New Order - Blue Monday
David Bowie - Heroes
Stevie Wonder - I just called to say I love you
Queen - Don't stop me now


Hmmm... the DJ seems to like coming back to "Teardrop" despite it still being in its history... or maybe just because it is?
Maybe it should be added to the "diversity mandate" that the DJ should avoid repeating any track still visible in its history, unless it was specifically requested.
On the upside, the track matching now works better... the DJ just suggested "Superstition" again and picked "I just called to say I love you" from the alternative suggestions again, and this time Orchestrator picked the correct version of it.
