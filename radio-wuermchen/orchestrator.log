Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.

Heute Nachmittag

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: Neues Machtgefüge: Kurden in Syrien mit ungewisser Zukunft
Story: Nach schweren Kämpfen und dem Vormarsch syrischer Regierungstruppen steht die kurdische Selbstverwaltung im Nordosten Syriens faktisch vor dem Aus. Am Donnerstag übernahm die Regierung nach dem US-Abzug den strategisch wichtigen Stützpunkt al-Tanf – ein weiteres Signal für das neue Machtgefüge. Ein Abkommen zwischen Damaskus und den kurdisch dominierten Syrischen Demokratischen Kräften (SDF) stoppte zwar die Gewalt, viele Details bleiben jedoch ungeklärt. Fachleute sehen gegenüber ORF.at offene Fragen für die Zukunft und warnen vor neuen Spannungen in der Region.

Summarize this story engagingly for the radio audience, then suggest and introduce a song that fits the topic or mood of this story.
