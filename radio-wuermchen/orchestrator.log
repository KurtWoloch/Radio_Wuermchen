Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.

Heute Nachmittag

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: Neues Machtgefüge: Kurden in Syrien mit ungewisser Zukunft
Story: Nach schweren Kämpfen und dem Vormarsch syrischer Regierungstruppen steht die kurdische Selbstverwaltung im Nordosten Syriens faktisch vor dem Aus. Am Donnerstag übernahm die Regierung nach dem US-Abzug den strategisch wichtigen Stützpunkt al-Tanf – ein weiteres Signal für das neue Machtgefüge. Ein Abkommen zwischen Damaskus und den kurdisch dominierten Syrischen Demokratischen Kräften (SDF) stoppte zwar die Gewalt, viele Details bleiben jedoch ungeklärt. Fachleute sehen gegenüber ORF.at offene Fragen für die Zukunft und warnen vor neuen Spannungen in der Region.

Summarize this story engagingly for the radio audience, then suggest and introduce a song that fits the topic or mood of this story.

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: Neues Machtgefüge: Kurden in Syrien mit ungewisser Zukunft
Story: Nach schweren Kämpfen und dem Vormarsch syrischer Regierungstruppen steht die kurdische Selbstverwaltung im Nordosten Syriens faktisch vor dem Aus. Am Donnerstag übernahm die Regierung nach dem US-Abzug den strategisch wichtigen Stützpunkt al-Tanf – ein weiteres Signal für das neue Machtgefüge. Ein Abkommen zwischen Damaskus und den kurdisch dominierten Syrischen Demokratischen Kräften (SDF) stoppte zwar die Gewalt, viele Details bleiben jedoch ungeklärt. Fachleute sehen gegenüber ORF.at offene Fragen für die Zukunft und warnen vor neuen Spannungen in der Region.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen!

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: Neues Machtgefüge: Kurden in Syrien mit ungewisser Zukunft
Story: Nach schweren Kämpfen und dem Vormarsch syrischer Regierungstruppen steht die kurdische Selbstverwaltung im Nordosten Syriens faktisch vor dem Aus. Am Donnerstag übernahm die Regierung nach dem US-Abzug den strategisch wichtigen Stützpunkt al-Tanf – ein weiteres Signal für das neue Machtgefüge. Ein Abkommen zwischen Damaskus und den kurdisch dominierten Syrischen Demokratischen Kräften (SDF) stoppte zwar die Gewalt, viele Details bleiben jedoch ungeklärt. Fachleute sehen gegenüber ORF.at offene Fragen für die Zukunft und warnen vor neuen Spannungen in der Region.

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: Neues Machtgefüge: Kurden in Syrien mit ungewisser Zukunft
Story: Nach schweren Kämpfen und dem Vormarsch syrischer Regierungstruppen steht die kurdische Selbstverwaltung im Nordosten Syriens faktisch vor dem Aus. Am Donnerstag übernahm die Regierung nach dem US-Abzug den strategisch wichtigen Stützpunkt al-Tanf – ein weiteres Signal für das neue Machtgefüge. Ein Abkommen zwischen Damaskus und den kurdisch dominierten Syrischen Demokratischen Kräften (SDF) stoppte zwar die Gewalt, viele Details bleiben jedoch ungeklärt. Fachleute sehen gegenüber ORF.at offene Fragen für die Zukunft und warnen vor neuen Spannungen in der Region.

Headline: Flocks Kreis schließt sich als Goldmedaille
Story: Drei Tage vor dem „Jubiläum“ ihrer schwersten Niederlage vor acht Jahren in Südkorea hat sich für Janine Flock am Samstag in Cortina d’Ampezzo der olympische Kreis in Form der Goldmedaille geschlossen. Die Skeletoni aus Tirol erfüllte sich mit vier nahezu makellosen Läufen ihren Traum. „Es ist das Highlight meiner Karriere“, sagte eine überwältigte Flock mit der Goldenen um den Hals. Den Frust von 2018 bündelte sie im entscheidenden Moment zu ihrem größten Triumph.

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Kallas wehrt sich gegen Schlechtreden von Europa
Story: Die EU-Außenbeauftragte Kaja Kallas hält die Kritik von US-Politikern an der Europäischen Union für unangemessen und wenig glaubhaft. Es falle ihr "sehr schwer", diese Vorwürfe zu glauben, sagte sie heute auf der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz.
Als Beispiel nannte sie Kritik an der Pressefreiheit aus einem Land, das auf Platz 58 im Pressefreiheitsindex stehe, wogegen ihre Heimat Estland auf Platz zwei gelistet werde.Kallas betonte, dass die gestrige Rede von US-Außenminister Marco Rubio sowohl Botschaften für die Europäer und Europäerinnen als auch Botschaften für die Öffentlichkeit in den USA enthalten habe, insbesondere für die dortigen Wähler."Europa-Bashing in Mode""Europa-Bashing" sei derzeit "gerade sehr in Mode" – trotz all "der guten Dinge, die Europa tatsächlich zu bieten hat". Zugleich habe Rubios Rede klargemacht, "dass Amerika und Europa miteinander verflochten sind, in der Vergangenheit waren und auch in Zukunft sein werden. Ich halte das für wichtig.""Wenn ich um die Welt reise, sehe ich Länder, die zu uns aufschauen, weil wir Werte vertreten, die immer noch hoch im Kurs stehen", sagte Kallas und nannte die Verteidigung der Menschenrechte und den Wohlstand.

Headline: Obama über Trump-Video mit Affen: "Anstand verloren"
Story: Der frühere US-Präsident Barack Obama hat sich erstmals über ein von Amtsinhaber Donald Trump veröffentlichtes Video geäußert, das ihn und seine Ehefrau Michelle als Affen verunglimpfte.Obama beklagte dabei gestern in einem Interview mit dem linksgerichteten Politikpodcaster Brian Tyler Cohen fehlende "Scham" und fehlenden "Anstand" in der Politik. Die meisten US-Bürger würden ein solches Verhalten als "zutiefst verstörend" empfinden."Antwort wird vom Volk kommen""Es gibt so eine Art Clown-Show in den sozialen Netzwerken und im Fernsehen", sagte Obama, ohne Trump beim Namen zu nennen. "Es scheint keinerlei Scham mehr darüber bei Menschen zu geben, die einst dachten, dass es Anstand, einen Sinn für Anständigkeit und Respekt für das Amt geben sollte, richtig? Das ist verloren gegangen."Der Demokrat sagte voraus, dass ein solches Verhalten Trumps Republikanern bei den Zwischenwahlen im November schaden werde. "Letztlich wird die Antwort vom amerikanischen Volk kommen", sagte der US-Präsident der Jahre 2009 bis 2017.Das Video war am 5. Februar auf Trumps Nutzerkonto auf seiner Onlineplattform Truth Social veröffentlicht worden. In dem Video ging es um vermeintliche Beweise für Manipulation bei der Präsidentschaftswahl 2020, die Trump gegen den Demokraten Joe Biden verloren hatte.Obamas Köpfe auf AffenkörpernAm Ende des Videos sind kurz die lachenden Köpfe von Michelle und Barack Obama auf Affenkörpern zu sehen. Der erste afroamerikanische Präsident der US-Geschichte und seine Ehefrau tanzten darin vor einer Dschungelkulisse.Das Video sorgte für einen Aufschrei der Empörung, Trump wurde Rassismus vorgeworfen. Auch Parteifreunde des rechtspopulistischen Präsidenten kritisierten das Video scharf.Trumps Sprecherin Karoline Leavitt sprach zunächst von "gespielter Empörung", bevor das Weiße Haus das Video entfernte und erklärte, ein Mitarbeiter habe den Beitrag "irrtümlich veröffentlicht". Trump beteuerte später, er habe "nur den ersten Teil angesehen und nicht das ganze Video".

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: Streit um Begnadigung: Trump attackiert Israels Präsidenten
Story: Eine verbale Attacke des US-Präsidenten Donald Trump gegen den israelischen Staatspräsidenten Yitzhak (Isaac) Herzog sorgt in Israel für Spannungen. Trump hatte vor Reportern im Weißen Haus gesagt, Herzog müsse sich "schämen", weil er den wegen Korruption angeklagten israelischen Ministerpräsidenten Benjamin Netanjahu bisher nicht begnadigt habe. Der Regierungschef habe immerhin in Kriegszeiten Außergewöhnliches geleistet, erklärte der US-Präsident.Das Büro des israelischen Präsidenten stellte daraufhin klar, Herzog habe anders als von Trump dargestellt noch keine Entscheidung in der Begnadigungsfrage getroffen. Der Antrag, den Netanjahu im November gestellt hatte, werde noch im Justizministerium gemäß den festgelegten Verfahren geprüft.Herzog schätze Trump zutiefst für seine Unterstützung des jüdischen Staates. Israel sei jedoch ein souveräner Staat, der nach dem Prinzip der Rechtsstaatlichkeit regiert werde, hieß es weiter.Spekulationen nach TreffenKurz vor der Attacke Trumps gegen Herzog hatte der US-Präsident Netanjahu im Weißen Haus getroffen. Nach Medienberichten hat Herzogs Büro deshalb Erklärungen darüber gefordert, ob Netanjahu Trump zu seinen Äußerungen gegen den israelischen Präsidenten ermutigt habe.Aus Kreisen um Netanjahu verlautete daraufhin, die Forderung Trumps nach einer Begnadigung sei ausschließlich auf Initiative des US-Präsidenten selbst erfolgt. Netanjahu hatte Herzog in einem Schreiben offiziell um Begnadigung gebeten.

Headline: Weiter Kontroverse um UNO-Berichterstatterin Albanese
Story: Nach den Regierungen von Frankreich und Deutschland fordert nun auch Tschechien die Abberufung von Francesca Albanese, UNO-Sonderberichterstatterin für die besetzten palästinensischen Gebiete. Das berichteten italienische Medien.Zudem haben sich 40 britische Abgeordnete an Innenministerin Yvette Cooper gewandt und sie aufgefordert, ebenfalls Albaneses Rücktritt zu verlangen. In Italien bekräftigte Außenminister Antonio Tajani, dass "die Erklärungen und das Verhalten" der italienischen Juristin es "unumgänglich machen, ihren Rücktritt zu verlangen".Die Regierungspartei Fratelli d’Italia (Brüder Italiens) startete eine öffentliche Unterschriftensammlung zur Forderung der Mandatsenthebung. Nach Angaben der Initiatoren seien in den ersten zwölf Stunden "zehntausend Unterschriften" gesammelt worden.Rückhalt erhielt Albanese hingegen von Italiens Oppositionspartei Allianz Verdi e Sinistra (Avs) sowie von einzelnen Abgeordneten der Partito Democratico (PD – Demokratische Partei) und der Fünf-Sterne-Bewegung.Meinl-Reisinger-Post gelöschtSeit Tagen hagelt es Kritik an der UNO-Sonderberichterstatterin für die palästinensischen Gebiete. Auch Außenministerin Beate Meinl-Reisinger (NEOS) hatte sich dem Protest gegen die italienische Juristin angeschlossen. Ein entsprechender Post auf der Plattform X wurde am Freitag aber später gelöscht.Hintergrund des Wirbels sind israelkritische Aussagen von Albanese bei einer Konferenz in Doha, die Anfang Februar über die Bühne ging.

Headline: Israel greift erneut Ziele im Libanon an
Story: Das israelische Militär hat erneut mehrere Ziele im Libanon angegriffen. Im Süden des Nachbarlandes seien in mehreren Gebieten Waffenlager und Raketenwerfer der Hisbollah-Miliz attackiert worden, teilte das Militär in der Nacht auf heute mit.Die Präsenz der Waffen stelle einen Verstoß gegen die Waffenruhevereinbarung zwischen Israel und dem Libanon dar, hieß es. Die Hisbollah versuche weiterhin, ihre "Terrorinfrastruktur im Südlibanon wieder aufzubauen", erklärte Israels Armee.Nach offiziellen libanesischen Angaben wurden seit Inkrafttreten der Waffenruhe im November 2024 mehr als 300 Menschen im Libanon durch israelische Angriffe getötet. Den Vereinten Nationen zufolge waren mehr als 100 davon Zivilisten und Zivilistinnen.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Ukrainischer Ex-Energieminister festgenommen
Story: Der wegen Korruptionsverdacht entlassene frühere ukrainische Energieminister Herman Haluschtschenko ist bei einer versuchten Ausreise aus dem Land festgenommen worden. Das teilten die für Korruptionsbekämpfung zuständigen Kiewer Behörden SAP und Nabu auf ihren Telegram-Kanälen heute mit.
Die Ermittlungen in dem weitverzweigten Fall von Bestechlichkeit dauerten an. Im vergangenen November hatten ukrainische Korruptionsfahnder Vorwürfe gegen eine Gruppe mutmaßlich bestechlicher Staatsdiener direkt im Umfeld von Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj erhoben.Sie sollen sich im staatlichen Konzern Ernerhoatom an Geld vergriffen haben, das eigentlich für Schutzbauten um Energieanlagen gegen feindliche Luftangriffe bestimmt war. Haluschtschenko, einer der Beschuldigten, musste als Energieminister gehen.Dem Selenskyj-Vertrauten Tymur Minditsch gelang die Flucht. Der Präsident baute daraufhin die Regierung um und ersetzte auch seinen einflussreichen Stabschef Andrij Jermak.

Headline: 208 Häftlinge im Vorjahr in Herkunftsstaat überstellt
Story: Im Jahr 2025 wurden 208 Personen zur Strafvollstreckung aus Österreich in ihren Herkunftsstaat gebracht. Das ist ein Höchstwert seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen 2013. Ein Jahr zuvor waren es 167 Personen, zehn Jahre zuvor 144. Das geht aus Zahlen des Justizministeriums hervor.Dazu kamen 2025 insgesamt 394 Personen mit Einreise- oder Aufenthaltsverboten, die aus dem Strafvollzug in ihre Heimatländer gebracht wurden. Die Justiz will die "Haft in der Heimat" weiter ausbauen.Die vermehrte Überstellung von Strafgefangenen in den Herkunftsstaat sei "ein wichtiges Anliegen, um die heimischen Gefängnisse zu entlasten und eine bessere Resozialisierung von Strafgefangenen in der Heimat zu ermöglichen", hieß es aus dem SPÖ-geführten Justizressort.Meisten Überstellungen innerhalb EuropasEin Großteil der Ersuchen und Überstellungen betreffe das EU- bzw. europäische Ausland. Rechtsgrundlage sind ein Rahmenbeschluss der Europäischen Union aus dem Jahr 2008 sowie das Übereinkommen über die Überstellung verurteilter Personen des Europarats."Die Überstellung in den heimatlichen Strafvollzug hängt nicht direkt mit dem Delikt zusammen, sondern vielmehr mit der Dauer der in Österreich verhängten Freiheitsstrafe", teilte das Justizministerium mit. Ein Ansuchen sei nur sinnvoll, wenn noch "ausreichend Strafzeit" vorhanden sei und keine bedingte Entlassung anstehe.Die Kosten für Überstellungen sind laut Ministerium "je nach individuellem Fall sehr unterschiedlich". Insgesamt "überwiegen die ersparten Haftkosten jedoch den Aufwand der Außerlandesbringungen".

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Acht abgetrennte Köpfe in Ecuador entdeckt
Story: In der Küstenprovinz Guayas in Ecuador sind acht abgetrennte menschliche Köpfe entdeckt worden. Nahe der Köpfe seien Zettel mit der Aufschrift "Stehlen verboten" gefunden worden, sagte Polizeikommandeur Marcelo Castillo gestern.
Hintergrund der Tat seien vermutlich Auseinandersetzungen zwischen "kriminellen Banden". Erst im vergangenen Jänner waren an einem Strand in Ecuador fünf Köpfe entdeckt worden.Erbitterte Kämpfe zwischen Drogenbanden haben Ecuador in das gewalttätigste Land Südamerikas verwandelt. Im vergangenen Jahr lag die Mordrate nach Angaben des Innenministeriums bei 54 pro 100.000 Einwohnern. Das entspricht einem Mord pro Stunde.Ecuador liegt zwischen den beiden weltgrößten Kokainproduzenten Kolumbien und Peru und hat sich zu einem wichtigen Transitland für den Drogenhandel entwickelt. Rund 70 Prozent des Kokains wird an Ecuadors Häfen am Pazifik umgeschlagen, Ziel sind zumeist die USA oder Europa.

Headline: Babler: Abgabe für Streamingdienste kommt demnächst
Story: Kulturminister Andreas Babler (SPÖ) und der für Auslandskultur zuständige Staatssekretär Sepp Schellhorn (NEOS) haben sich heute bei einem Empfang in der österreichischen Botschaft in Berlin zur laufenden Debatte um Finanzierungsmodelle der Filmbranche geäußert.Zumindest die Frage des Investitionsbeitrags – also einer Abgabe der Streamingunternehmen – sei vonseiten des Kulturministeriums auf der Zielgeraden: "Wir sind jetzt im Februar so weit, dass wir in die politische Koordinierung gehen können", sagte Babler. "Ich bekenne mich zur Streamingabgabe – sie muss kommen.""Aber das frische Geld für den Anschub aufzustellen, ist das Schwierige", so Babler. Auch Schellhorn unterstrich die Bedeutung des österreichischen Films als Exportgut und bekannte sich allgemein zur finanziellen Ausstattung.Fachverband erfreutWKO-Fachverbandsobmann Alexander Dumreicher-Ivanceanu reagierte erfreut: "Wir wissen, dass es in die richtige Richtung geht." Schließlich flössen die Einnahmen aus den rund 600 Millionen Euro an Umsätzen, die von den Streamingdiensten in Österreich generiert würden, derzeit zu 99,9 Prozent aus dem Land ab: "Das geht einfach nicht."Allerdings dürfe neben der Investitionsabgabe auch nicht auf die Investitionsverpflichtungen wie in Deutschland vergessen werden. "Unser Appell geht hier an die gesamte Regierung", verwies Dumreicher-Ivanceanu auf die nötige Beteiligung des Wirtschaftsministeriums in dieser Frage.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: AK-Chefin plädiert für Reichen- und Erbschaftssteuer
Story: Die Präsidentin der Arbeiterkammer (AK), Renate Anderl (SPÖ), fordert angesichts der angespannten Budgetlage eine Reichen- und Erbschaftssteuer. Sie werde auch die entsprechende Petition der Grünen unterschreiben, sagte sie heute in der ORF-"Pressestunde".Zudem kann sie sich eine höhere Bankenabgabe sowie eine Rücknahme der Senkung der Körperschaftsteuer vorstellen. Auch härtere Strafen für Betriebe, die Überstunden nicht korrekt ausbezahlen, seien denkbar. Den Beschäftigten würde hier jährlich rund eine Milliarde an Entgelten entgehen.
Betriebe an Sozialstaat beteiligenWeiters sollten Unternehmen, die ihre Beschäftigten beim Arbeitsmarktservice (AMS) "zwischenparken", einen höheren Teil der entsprechenden Kosten tragen. Einer von den SPÖ-Koalitionspartnern ÖVP und NEOS geforderten Lohnnebenkostensenkung würde sie ohne Gegenfinanzierung nicht zustimmen. Es sei schließlich auch Aufgabe der Betriebe, sich am Sozialstaat zu beteiligen.Wenig Freude hat Anderl auch mit dem ÖVP-Vorschlag nach einer abgespeckten Basisgesundheitsversorgung für Asylwerberinnen und Asylwerber. "Wenn jemand eine medizinische Versorgung braucht, dann soll er auch den Zugang dazu haben."Das gelte auch für Gastpatienten, einem Thema, bei dem es derzeit zwischen der Stadt Wien und den Bundesländern brodelt. Als Kritik an der von der SPÖ geführten Wiener Stadtregierung wollte Anderl ihre Aussage auf Nachfrage hin aber nicht verstanden wissen."Perplex" angesichts Niessls KandidaturÜberrascht zeigte sie sich mit Blick auf die Ankündigung des früheren burgenländischen Landeshauptmanns Hans Niessl (SPÖ), für die SPÖ ins Rennen um die Hofburg gehen zu wollen. "Ich weiß nicht, wieso er diese Idee hatte oder wer ihn dazu getrieben hat", so Anderl.Sie sei "perplex" gewesen, als sie davon hörte. An der Staatsspitze würde sie sich eher eine Frau wünschen, "das wäre schon schön".Mehr Frauen an der Spitze wünscht sie sich insgesamt auch weiterhin in ihrer eigenen Partei, stellte sich zugleich aber auch hinter SPÖ-Parteichef Andreas Babler. Angesprochen auf die jüngst abgeflaute Führungsdebatte innerhalb der Roten, sagte Anderl: "Wir haben einige Männer im Land, die glauben, sie seien die allerwichtigsten." Namen nennen wollte sie aber nicht – sie würde dabei sicher "den einen oder anderen vergessen".

Heute Nachmittag

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Heute Nachmittag

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Israel billigt umstrittene Westjordanland-Entscheidung
Story: Die israelische Regierung hat nach Medienberichten einen höchst umstrittenen Vorschlag gebilligt, der israelischen Siedlern den Erwerb von Land im Westjordanland erleichtern soll.Verteidigungsminister Israel Katz sprach nach Angaben des israelischen TV-Senders N12 von einem "wesentlichen sicherheits- und verwaltungspolitischen Schritt, der darauf abzielt, die volle Kontrolle, Durchsetzungskraft und Handlungsfreiheit des Staates Israel im Gebiet zu gewährleisten".Finanzminister Bezalel Smotrich sagte demnach: "Wir setzen die Revolution der Siedlungspolitik und der Kontrolle über alle Teile unseres Landes fort." Zum ersten Mal seit dem Sechstagekrieg 1967 "bringen wir Ordnung und Regierungsführung in die Verwaltung des Bodens in Judäa und Samaria (Westjordanland) zurück".Scharfe Kritik von Peace NowDie israelische Organisation Peace Now teilte als Reaktion auf die neue Entscheidung mit: "Die Regierung hat einen massiven Raub von Land im Westjordanland genehmigt – auf dem Weg zu einer De-facto-Annexion, völlig entgegen dem Willen des Volkes und im Widerspruch zum israelischen Interesse."Die deutsche Bundesregierung hatte bereits scharfe Kritik geübt. Die Entscheidung "widerspricht Israels völkerrechtlichen Verpflichtungen", hatte ein Sprecher des Auswärtigen Amts in Berlin gesagt. Sie stelle "einen weiteren Schritt zu einer faktischen Annexion" dar.
