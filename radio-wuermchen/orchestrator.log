Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.. You may weave weather info naturally into your announcement if it fits.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch und anfangs kann es auch noch etwas schneien. Am längsten schneit es im Wienerwald, bis Mittag ist es aber überall trocken. Zwischen den Wolken scheint die Sonne, die längsten sonnigen Phasen gehen sich am Nachmittag aus. Bei kräftigem, eisigem Nordwestwind kommt die Temperatur nicht über minus 1 bis plus 2 Grad hinaus.

Morgen, Montag

Milder und abwechselnd bewölkte und sonnige Phasen. Vereinzelt auch kurze Schnee-, Regen oder Graupelschauer. Mäßiger Wind aus Südwest bis Südost und höchstens 5 Grad.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Sonnenschein und dichte Wolken wechseln. Dabei können in der Früh kurze Schneeschauer und tagsüber einzelne Regenschauer durchziehen. Der Westwind legt im Laufe des Tages zu und wird lebhaft, im Wienerwald kräftig und die Temperatur erreicht um 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch mehr Sonne und im Laufe des Tages nachlassender Wind. In der Früh und am Vormittag noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind. Am Nachmittag bei etwa 6 Grad nur mehr schwacher bis mäßiger Wind, der auf Nordost dreht.

Am Donnerstag mit kräftigem Südostwind zunehmend bewölkt und im Laufe des Tages Regen und Regenschauer. Dazu ein Höchstwert um 8 Grad. Zum Abend hin trüb und vermutlich länger anhaltender Regen.

Heute Nachmittag

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

It's time for a weather update! Please present the full weather forecast to the listeners in your own words, then suggest and introduce a song that fits the current weather mood.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Heute Nachmittag

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: Neues Machtgefüge: Kurden in Syrien mit ungewisser Zukunft
Story: Nach schweren Kämpfen und dem Vormarsch syrischer Regierungstruppen steht die kurdische Selbstverwaltung im Nordosten Syriens faktisch vor dem Aus. Am Donnerstag übernahm die Regierung nach dem US-Abzug den strategisch wichtigen Stützpunkt al-Tanf – ein weiteres Signal für das neue Machtgefüge. Ein Abkommen zwischen Damaskus und den kurdisch dominierten Syrischen Demokratischen Kräften (SDF) stoppte zwar die Gewalt, viele Details bleiben jedoch ungeklärt. Fachleute sehen gegenüber ORF.at offene Fragen für die Zukunft und warnen vor neuen Spannungen in der Region.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Neues Machtgefüge: Kurden in Syrien mit ungewisser Zukunft
Story: Nach schweren Kämpfen und dem Vormarsch syrischer Regierungstruppen steht die kurdische Selbstverwaltung im Nordosten Syriens faktisch vor dem Aus. Am Donnerstag übernahm die Regierung nach dem US-Abzug den strategisch wichtigen Stützpunkt al-Tanf – ein weiteres Signal für das neue Machtgefüge. Ein Abkommen zwischen Damaskus und den kurdisch dominierten Syrischen Demokratischen Kräften (SDF) stoppte zwar die Gewalt, viele Details bleiben jedoch ungeklärt. Fachleute sehen gegenüber ORF.at offene Fragen für die Zukunft und warnen vor neuen Spannungen in der Region.

Headline: Neues Machtgefüge: Kurden in Syrien mit ungewisser Zukunft
Story: Nach schweren Kämpfen und dem Vormarsch syrischer Regierungstruppen steht die kurdische Selbstverwaltung im Nordosten Syriens faktisch vor dem Aus. Am Donnerstag übernahm die Regierung nach dem US-Abzug den strategisch wichtigen Stützpunkt al-Tanf – ein weiteres Signal für das neue Machtgefüge. Ein Abkommen zwischen Damaskus und den kurdisch dominierten Syrischen Demokratischen Kräften (SDF) stoppte zwar die Gewalt, viele Details bleiben jedoch ungeklärt. Fachleute sehen gegenüber ORF.at offene Fragen für die Zukunft und warnen vor neuen Spannungen in der Region.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Neues Machtgefüge: Kurden in Syrien mit ungewisser Zukunft
Story: Nach schweren Kämpfen und dem Vormarsch syrischer Regierungstruppen steht die kurdische Selbstverwaltung im Nordosten Syriens faktisch vor dem Aus. Am Donnerstag übernahm die Regierung nach dem US-Abzug den strategisch wichtigen Stützpunkt al-Tanf – ein weiteres Signal für das neue Machtgefüge. Ein Abkommen zwischen Damaskus und den kurdisch dominierten Syrischen Demokratischen Kräften (SDF) stoppte zwar die Gewalt, viele Details bleiben jedoch ungeklärt. Fachleute sehen gegenüber ORF.at offene Fragen für die Zukunft und warnen vor neuen Spannungen in der Region.

Headline: Flocks Kreis schließt sich als Goldmedaille
Story: Drei Tage vor dem „Jubiläum“ ihrer schwersten Niederlage vor acht Jahren in Südkorea hat sich für Janine Flock am Samstag in Cortina d’Ampezzo der olympische Kreis in Form der Goldmedaille geschlossen. Die Skeletoni aus Tirol erfüllte sich mit vier nahezu makellosen Läufen ihren Traum. „Es ist das Highlight meiner Karriere“, sagte eine überwältigte Flock mit der Goldenen um den Hals. Den Frust von 2018 bündelte sie im entscheidenden Moment zu ihrem größten Triumph.

Heute Nachmittag

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Kallas wehrt sich gegen Schlechtreden von Europa
Story: Die EU-Außenbeauftragte Kaja Kallas hält die Kritik von US-Politikern an der Europäischen Union für unangemessen und wenig glaubhaft. Es falle ihr "sehr schwer", diese Vorwürfe zu glauben, sagte sie heute auf der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz.
Als Beispiel nannte sie Kritik an der Pressefreiheit aus einem Land, das auf Platz 58 im Pressefreiheitsindex stehe, wogegen ihre Heimat Estland auf Platz zwei gelistet werde.Kallas betonte, dass die gestrige Rede von US-Außenminister Marco Rubio sowohl Botschaften für die Europäer und Europäerinnen als auch Botschaften für die Öffentlichkeit in den USA enthalten habe, insbesondere für die dortigen Wähler."Europa-Bashing in Mode""Europa-Bashing" sei derzeit "gerade sehr in Mode" – trotz all "der guten Dinge, die Europa tatsächlich zu bieten hat". Zugleich habe Rubios Rede klargemacht, "dass Amerika und Europa miteinander verflochten sind, in der Vergangenheit waren und auch in Zukunft sein werden. Ich halte das für wichtig.""Wenn ich um die Welt reise, sehe ich Länder, die zu uns aufschauen, weil wir Werte vertreten, die immer noch hoch im Kurs stehen", sagte Kallas und nannte die Verteidigung der Menschenrechte und den Wohlstand.

Headline: Obama über Trump-Video mit Affen: "Anstand verloren"
Story: Der frühere US-Präsident Barack Obama hat sich erstmals über ein von Amtsinhaber Donald Trump veröffentlichtes Video geäußert, das ihn und seine Ehefrau Michelle als Affen verunglimpfte.Obama beklagte dabei gestern in einem Interview mit dem linksgerichteten Politikpodcaster Brian Tyler Cohen fehlende "Scham" und fehlenden "Anstand" in der Politik. Die meisten US-Bürger würden ein solches Verhalten als "zutiefst verstörend" empfinden."Antwort wird vom Volk kommen""Es gibt so eine Art Clown-Show in den sozialen Netzwerken und im Fernsehen", sagte Obama, ohne Trump beim Namen zu nennen. "Es scheint keinerlei Scham mehr darüber bei Menschen zu geben, die einst dachten, dass es Anstand, einen Sinn für Anständigkeit und Respekt für das Amt geben sollte, richtig? Das ist verloren gegangen."Der Demokrat sagte voraus, dass ein solches Verhalten Trumps Republikanern bei den Zwischenwahlen im November schaden werde. "Letztlich wird die Antwort vom amerikanischen Volk kommen", sagte der US-Präsident der Jahre 2009 bis 2017.Das Video war am 5. Februar auf Trumps Nutzerkonto auf seiner Onlineplattform Truth Social veröffentlicht worden. In dem Video ging es um vermeintliche Beweise für Manipulation bei der Präsidentschaftswahl 2020, die Trump gegen den Demokraten Joe Biden verloren hatte.Obamas Köpfe auf AffenkörpernAm Ende des Videos sind kurz die lachenden Köpfe von Michelle und Barack Obama auf Affenkörpern zu sehen. Der erste afroamerikanische Präsident der US-Geschichte und seine Ehefrau tanzten darin vor einer Dschungelkulisse.Das Video sorgte für einen Aufschrei der Empörung, Trump wurde Rassismus vorgeworfen. Auch Parteifreunde des rechtspopulistischen Präsidenten kritisierten das Video scharf.Trumps Sprecherin Karoline Leavitt sprach zunächst von "gespielter Empörung", bevor das Weiße Haus das Video entfernte und erklärte, ein Mitarbeiter habe den Beitrag "irrtümlich veröffentlicht". Trump beteuerte später, er habe "nur den ersten Teil angesehen und nicht das ganze Video".

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Headline: Obama über Trump-Video mit Affen: "Anstand verloren"
Story: Der frühere US-Präsident Barack Obama hat sich erstmals über ein von Amtsinhaber Donald Trump veröffentlichtes Video geäußert, das ihn und seine Ehefrau Michelle als Affen verunglimpfte.Obama beklagte dabei gestern in einem Interview mit dem linksgerichteten Politikpodcaster Brian Tyler Cohen fehlende "Scham" und fehlenden "Anstand" in der Politik. Die meisten US-Bürger würden ein solches Verhalten als "zutiefst verstörend" empfinden."Antwort wird vom Volk kommen""Es gibt so eine Art Clown-Show in den sozialen Netzwerken und im Fernsehen", sagte Obama, ohne Trump beim Namen zu nennen. "Es scheint keinerlei Scham mehr darüber bei Menschen zu geben, die einst dachten, dass es Anstand, einen Sinn für Anständigkeit und Respekt für das Amt geben sollte, richtig? Das ist verloren gegangen."Der Demokrat sagte voraus, dass ein solches Verhalten Trumps Republikanern bei den Zwischenwahlen im November schaden werde. "Letztlich wird die Antwort vom amerikanischen Volk kommen", sagte der US-Präsident der Jahre 2009 bis 2017.Das Video war am 5. Februar auf Trumps Nutzerkonto auf seiner Onlineplattform Truth Social veröffentlicht worden. In dem Video ging es um vermeintliche Beweise für Manipulation bei der Präsidentschaftswahl 2020, die Trump gegen den Demokraten Joe Biden verloren hatte.Obamas Köpfe auf AffenkörpernAm Ende des Videos sind kurz die lachenden Köpfe von Michelle und Barack Obama auf Affenkörpern zu sehen. Der erste afroamerikanische Präsident der US-Geschichte und seine Ehefrau tanzten darin vor einer Dschungelkulisse.Das Video sorgte für einen Aufschrei der Empörung, Trump wurde Rassismus vorgeworfen. Auch Parteifreunde des rechtspopulistischen Präsidenten kritisierten das Video scharf.Trumps Sprecherin Karoline Leavitt sprach zunächst von "gespielter Empörung", bevor das Weiße Haus das Video entfernte und erklärte, ein Mitarbeiter habe den Beitrag "irrtümlich veröffentlicht". Trump beteuerte später, er habe "nur den ersten Teil angesehen und nicht das ganze Video".

Trump hatte vor Reportern im Weißen Haus gesagt, Herzog müsse sich "schämen", weil er den wegen Korruption angeklagten israelischen Ministerpräsidenten Benjamin Netanjahu bisher nicht begnadigt habe. Der Regierungschef habe immerhin in Kriegszeiten Außergewöhnliches geleistet, erklärte der US-Präsident.Das Büro des israelischen Präsidenten stellte daraufhin klar, Herzog habe anders als von Trump dargestellt noch keine Entscheidung in der Begnadigungsfrage getroffen. Der Antrag, den Netanjahu im November gestellt hatte, werde noch im Justizministerium gemäß den festgelegten Verfahren geprüft.Herzog schätze Trump zutiefst für seine Unterstützung des jüdischen Staates. Israel sei jedoch ein souveräner Staat, der nach dem Prinzip der Rechtsstaatlichkeit regiert werde, hieß es weiter.Spekulationen nach TreffenKurz vor der Attacke Trumps gegen Herzog hatte der US-Präsident Netanjahu im Weißen Haus getroffen. Nach Medienberichten hat Herzogs Büro deshalb Erklärungen darüber gefordert, ob Netanjahu Trump zu seinen Äußerungen gegen den israelischen Präsidenten ermutigt habe.Aus Kreisen um Netanjahu verlautete daraufhin, die Forderung Trumps nach einer Begnadigung sei ausschließlich auf Initiative des US-Präsidenten selbst erfolgt. Netanjahu hatte Herzog in einem Schreiben offiziell um Begnadigung gebeten.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Weiter Kontroverse um UNO-Berichterstatterin Albanese
Story: Nach den Regierungen von Frankreich und Deutschland fordert nun auch Tschechien die Abberufung von Francesca Albanese, UNO-Sonderberichterstatterin für die besetzten palästinensischen Gebiete. Das berichteten italienische Medien.Zudem haben sich 40 britische Abgeordnete an Innenministerin Yvette Cooper gewandt und sie aufgefordert, ebenfalls Albaneses Rücktritt zu verlangen. In Italien bekräftigte Außenminister Antonio Tajani, dass "die Erklärungen und das Verhalten" der italienischen Juristin es "unumgänglich machen, ihren Rücktritt zu verlangen".Die Regierungspartei Fratelli d’Italia (Brüder Italiens) startete eine öffentliche Unterschriftensammlung zur Forderung der Mandatsenthebung. Nach Angaben der Initiatoren seien in den ersten zwölf Stunden "zehntausend Unterschriften" gesammelt worden.Rückhalt erhielt Albanese hingegen von Italiens Oppositionspartei Allianz Verdi e Sinistra (Avs) sowie von einzelnen Abgeordneten der Partito Democratico (PD – Demokratische Partei) und der Fünf-Sterne-Bewegung.Meinl-Reisinger-Post gelöschtSeit Tagen hagelt es Kritik an der UNO-Sonderberichterstatterin für die palästinensischen Gebiete. Auch Außenministerin Beate Meinl-Reisinger (NEOS) hatte sich dem Protest gegen die italienische Juristin angeschlossen. Ein entsprechender Post auf der Plattform X wurde am Freitag aber später gelöscht.Hintergrund des Wirbels sind israelkritische Aussagen von Albanese bei einer Konferenz in Doha, die Anfang Februar über die Bühne ging.

Headline: Israel greift erneut Ziele im Libanon an
Story: Das israelische Militär hat erneut mehrere Ziele im Libanon angegriffen. Im Süden des Nachbarlandes seien in mehreren Gebieten Waffenlager und Raketenwerfer der Hisbollah-Miliz attackiert worden, teilte das Militär in der Nacht auf heute mit.Die Präsenz der Waffen stelle einen Verstoß gegen die Waffenruhevereinbarung zwischen Israel und dem Libanon dar, hieß es. Die Hisbollah versuche weiterhin, ihre "Terrorinfrastruktur im Südlibanon wieder aufzubauen", erklärte Israels Armee.Nach offiziellen libanesischen Angaben wurden seit Inkrafttreten der Waffenruhe im November 2024 mehr als 300 Menschen im Libanon durch israelische Angriffe getötet. Den Vereinten Nationen zufolge waren mehr als 100 davon Zivilisten und Zivilistinnen.

Headline: Ukrainischer Ex-Energieminister festgenommen
Story: Der wegen Korruptionsverdacht entlassene frühere ukrainische Energieminister Herman Haluschtschenko ist bei einer versuchten Ausreise aus dem Land festgenommen worden. Das teilten die für Korruptionsbekämpfung zuständigen Kiewer Behörden SAP und Nabu auf ihren Telegram-Kanälen heute mit.
Die Ermittlungen in dem weitverzweigten Fall von Bestechlichkeit dauerten an. Im vergangenen November hatten ukrainische Korruptionsfahnder Vorwürfe gegen eine Gruppe mutmaßlich bestechlicher Staatsdiener direkt im Umfeld von Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj erhoben.Sie sollen sich im staatlichen Konzern Ernerhoatom an Geld vergriffen haben, das eigentlich für Schutzbauten um Energieanlagen gegen feindliche Luftangriffe bestimmt war. Haluschtschenko, einer der Beschuldigten, musste als Energieminister gehen.Dem Selenskyj-Vertrauten Tymur Minditsch gelang die Flucht. Der Präsident baute daraufhin die Regierung um und ersetzte auch seinen einflussreichen Stabschef Andrij Jermak.

Headline: 208 Häftlinge im Vorjahr in Herkunftsstaat überstellt
Story: Im Jahr 2025 wurden 208 Personen zur Strafvollstreckung aus Österreich in ihren Herkunftsstaat gebracht. Das ist ein Höchstwert seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen 2013. Ein Jahr zuvor waren es 167 Personen, zehn Jahre zuvor 144. Das geht aus Zahlen des Justizministeriums hervor.Dazu kamen 2025 insgesamt 394 Personen mit Einreise- oder Aufenthaltsverboten, die aus dem Strafvollzug in ihre Heimatländer gebracht wurden. Die Justiz will die "Haft in der Heimat" weiter ausbauen.Die vermehrte Überstellung von Strafgefangenen in den Herkunftsstaat sei "ein wichtiges Anliegen, um die heimischen Gefängnisse zu entlasten und eine bessere Resozialisierung von Strafgefangenen in der Heimat zu ermöglichen", hieß es aus dem SPÖ-geführten Justizressort.Meisten Überstellungen innerhalb EuropasEin Großteil der Ersuchen und Überstellungen betreffe das EU- bzw. europäische Ausland. Rechtsgrundlage sind ein Rahmenbeschluss der Europäischen Union aus dem Jahr 2008 sowie das Übereinkommen über die Überstellung verurteilter Personen des Europarats."Die Überstellung in den heimatlichen Strafvollzug hängt nicht direkt mit dem Delikt zusammen, sondern vielmehr mit der Dauer der in Österreich verhängten Freiheitsstrafe", teilte das Justizministerium mit. Ein Ansuchen sei nur sinnvoll, wenn noch "ausreichend Strafzeit" vorhanden sei und keine bedingte Entlassung anstehe.Die Kosten für Überstellungen sind laut Ministerium "je nach individuellem Fall sehr unterschiedlich". Insgesamt "überwiegen die ersparten Haftkosten jedoch den Aufwand der Außerlandesbringungen".

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Acht abgetrennte Köpfe in Ecuador entdeckt
Story: In der Küstenprovinz Guayas in Ecuador sind acht abgetrennte menschliche Köpfe entdeckt worden. Nahe der Köpfe seien Zettel mit der Aufschrift "Stehlen verboten" gefunden worden, sagte Polizeikommandeur Marcelo Castillo gestern.
Hintergrund der Tat seien vermutlich Auseinandersetzungen zwischen "kriminellen Banden". Erst im vergangenen Jänner waren an einem Strand in Ecuador fünf Köpfe entdeckt worden.Erbitterte Kämpfe zwischen Drogenbanden haben Ecuador in das gewalttätigste Land Südamerikas verwandelt. Im vergangenen Jahr lag die Mordrate nach Angaben des Innenministeriums bei 54 pro 100.000 Einwohnern. Das entspricht einem Mord pro Stunde.Ecuador liegt zwischen den beiden weltgrößten Kokainproduzenten Kolumbien und Peru und hat sich zu einem wichtigen Transitland für den Drogenhandel entwickelt. Rund 70 Prozent des Kokains wird an Ecuadors Häfen am Pazifik umgeschlagen, Ziel sind zumeist die USA oder Europa.

Headline: Babler: Abgabe für Streamingdienste kommt demnächst
Story: Kulturminister Andreas Babler (SPÖ) und der für Auslandskultur zuständige Staatssekretär Sepp Schellhorn (NEOS) haben sich heute bei einem Empfang in der österreichischen Botschaft in Berlin zur laufenden Debatte um Finanzierungsmodelle der Filmbranche geäußert.Zumindest die Frage des Investitionsbeitrags – also einer Abgabe der Streamingunternehmen – sei vonseiten des Kulturministeriums auf der Zielgeraden: "Wir sind jetzt im Februar so weit, dass wir in die politische Koordinierung gehen können", sagte Babler. "Ich bekenne mich zur Streamingabgabe – sie muss kommen.""Aber das frische Geld für den Anschub aufzustellen, ist das Schwierige", so Babler. Auch Schellhorn unterstrich die Bedeutung des österreichischen Films als Exportgut und bekannte sich allgemein zur finanziellen Ausstattung.Fachverband erfreutWKO-Fachverbandsobmann Alexander Dumreicher-Ivanceanu reagierte erfreut: "Wir wissen, dass es in die richtige Richtung geht." Schließlich flössen die Einnahmen aus den rund 600 Millionen Euro an Umsätzen, die von den Streamingdiensten in Österreich generiert würden, derzeit zu 99,9 Prozent aus dem Land ab: "Das geht einfach nicht."Allerdings dürfe neben der Investitionsabgabe auch nicht auf die Investitionsverpflichtungen wie in Deutschland vergessen werden. "Unser Appell geht hier an die gesamte Regierung", verwies Dumreicher-Ivanceanu auf die nötige Beteiligung des Wirtschaftsministeriums in dieser Frage.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: AK-Chefin plädiert für Reichen- und Erbschaftssteuer
Story: Die Präsidentin der Arbeiterkammer (AK), Renate Anderl (SPÖ), fordert angesichts der angespannten Budgetlage eine Reichen- und Erbschaftssteuer. Sie werde auch die entsprechende Petition der Grünen unterschreiben, sagte sie heute in der ORF-"Pressestunde".Zudem kann sie sich eine höhere Bankenabgabe sowie eine Rücknahme der Senkung der Körperschaftsteuer vorstellen. Auch härtere Strafen für Betriebe, die Überstunden nicht korrekt ausbezahlen, seien denkbar. Den Beschäftigten würde hier jährlich rund eine Milliarde an Entgelten entgehen.
Betriebe an Sozialstaat beteiligenWeiters sollten Unternehmen, die ihre Beschäftigten beim Arbeitsmarktservice (AMS) "zwischenparken", einen höheren Teil der entsprechenden Kosten tragen. Einer von den SPÖ-Koalitionspartnern ÖVP und NEOS geforderten Lohnnebenkostensenkung würde sie ohne Gegenfinanzierung nicht zustimmen. Es sei schließlich auch Aufgabe der Betriebe, sich am Sozialstaat zu beteiligen.Wenig Freude hat Anderl auch mit dem ÖVP-Vorschlag nach einer abgespeckten Basisgesundheitsversorgung für Asylwerberinnen und Asylwerber. "Wenn jemand eine medizinische Versorgung braucht, dann soll er auch den Zugang dazu haben."Das gelte auch für Gastpatienten, einem Thema, bei dem es derzeit zwischen der Stadt Wien und den Bundesländern brodelt. Als Kritik an der von der SPÖ geführten Wiener Stadtregierung wollte Anderl ihre Aussage auf Nachfrage hin aber nicht verstanden wissen."Perplex" angesichts Niessls KandidaturÜberrascht zeigte sie sich mit Blick auf die Ankündigung des früheren burgenländischen Landeshauptmanns Hans Niessl (SPÖ), für die SPÖ ins Rennen um die Hofburg gehen zu wollen. "Ich weiß nicht, wieso er diese Idee hatte oder wer ihn dazu getrieben hat", so Anderl.Sie sei "perplex" gewesen, als sie davon hörte. An der Staatsspitze würde sie sich eher eine Frau wünschen, "das wäre schon schön".Mehr Frauen an der Spitze wünscht sie sich insgesamt auch weiterhin in ihrer eigenen Partei, stellte sich zugleich aber auch hinter SPÖ-Parteichef Andreas Babler. Angesprochen auf die jüngst abgeflaute Führungsdebatte innerhalb der Roten, sagte Anderl: "Wir haben einige Männer im Land, die glauben, sie seien die allerwichtigsten." Namen nennen wollte sie aber nicht – sie würde dabei sicher "den einen oder anderen vergessen".

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Es bleibt nun trocken, und die Wolken werden immer weniger. Der eisige Nordwestwind, der mit Spitzenböen um 50 km/h durch die Stadt weht, wird erst am Abend spürbar schwächer. Mit dem kräftigen Wind fühlt sich die Lufttemperatur um +1 Grad deutlich kälter an.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend klart es bei lebhaftem Nordwestwind auf. In der Nacht wird der schwächer und dreht auf Ost. Nach Mitternacht treffen immer mehr Wolken ein. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Meist stark bewölkt, zwischendurch Schneeflocken. Anfangs überwiegen die Wolken, von Westen her ziehen unergiebige Schneeschauer durch. Im Laufe des Tages kann sich zeitweise noch die Sonne zeigen. Der Wind weht mäßig aus Süd bis Südost, und die Temperatur steigt auf etwa 3 Grad.

In der Nacht auf Dienstag treffen Regen- und Schneeschauer ein: Glatteis durch gefrierenden Regen ist nicht ausgeschlossen.

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft, mit Westwind im Laufe des Tages milder als zuletzt. Immer wieder ziehen dichte Wolken, zwischendurch auch Schnee- und Regenschauer über die Stadt hinweg, anfangs kann es noch gefrierend regnen! Dazu weht mäßiger bis lebhafter, in den Wienerwald-Bezirken mitunter kräftiger W-Wind, der die Wolken zwischendurch ein bisschen auflockert und die Temperatur auf 5 oder 6 Grad treibt.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Israel billigt umstrittene Westjordanland-Entscheidung
Story: Die israelische Regierung hat nach Medienberichten einen höchst umstrittenen Vorschlag gebilligt, der israelischen Siedlern den Erwerb von Land im Westjordanland erleichtern soll.Verteidigungsminister Israel Katz sprach nach Angaben des israelischen TV-Senders N12 von einem "wesentlichen sicherheits- und verwaltungspolitischen Schritt, der darauf abzielt, die volle Kontrolle, Durchsetzungskraft und Handlungsfreiheit des Staates Israel im Gebiet zu gewährleisten".Finanzminister Bezalel Smotrich sagte demnach: "Wir setzen die Revolution der Siedlungspolitik und der Kontrolle über alle Teile unseres Landes fort." Zum ersten Mal seit dem Sechstagekrieg 1967 "bringen wir Ordnung und Regierungsführung in die Verwaltung des Bodens in Judäa und Samaria (Westjordanland) zurück".Scharfe Kritik von Peace NowDie israelische Organisation Peace Now teilte als Reaktion auf die neue Entscheidung mit: "Die Regierung hat einen massiven Raub von Land im Westjordanland genehmigt – auf dem Weg zu einer De-facto-Annexion, völlig entgegen dem Willen des Volkes und im Widerspruch zum israelischen Interesse."Die deutsche Bundesregierung hatte bereits scharfe Kritik geübt. Die Entscheidung "widerspricht Israels völkerrechtlichen Verpflichtungen", hatte ein Sprecher des Auswärtigen Amts in Berlin gesagt. Sie stelle "einen weiteren Schritt zu einer faktischen Annexion" dar.

Headline: Rubio: USA wollen Europa nicht als "Vasallen"
Story: US-Außenminister Marco Rubio ist heute in Bratislava mit dem slowakischen Regierungschef Robert Fico zusammengetroffen. Er betonte dabei das Interesse Washingtons an einem unabhängigen Europa als Partner der USA. "Wir verlangen von Europa nicht, ein Vasall der Vereinigten Staaten zu sein."Die US-Regierung wolle "kein abhängiges Europa", sondern einen "Partner". "Wir wollen mit unseren Verbündeten zusammenarbeiten", fügte Rubio hinzu. Er erklärte zudem, dass die USA keine Pläne hätten, aus der NATO auszutreten.Bei der zivilen Nutzung der Atomenergie wollen die USA und die Slowakei künftig enger kooperieren. Im kommenden Jahr sollen laufende Gespräche mit der US-Firma Westinghouse über den Bau eines fünften Atomreaktors in Jaslovske Bohunice in eine konkrete Vertragsunterzeichnung münden, sagten Fico und Rubio.Beim Thema Energie warnte Fico davor, dass die Ukraine Ungarn mit der ausbleibenden Reparatur der "Druschba"-Ölpipeline, die russisches Öl durch die Ukraine nach Ungarn und in die Slowakei transportiert, unter Druck setzen könne. Nach Bratislava ging es für Rubio nach Budapest weiter, wo er morgen mit Premier Viktor Orban zusammentrifft.

Story: Knapp zwei Monate vor der Parlamentswahl in Ungarn nimmt der Wahlkampf an Intensität zu. In einer Rede griff Oppositionsführer Peter Magyar den amtierenden Premier Viktor Orban am Sonntag scharf an. Orban sei nur zu „Hetze“ und „Drohungen“ fähig, nicht aber zur Auseinandersetzung mit den realen Problemen des Landes. Orban hatte Magyars Partei TISZA am Samstag als „Schöpfung“ des Auslands bezeichnet.

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch. Dazwischen zeigt sich die Sonne. Auch einzelne Schnee-, Regen- oder Graupelschauer können dabei sein. Es weht mäßiger bis lebhafter Wind meist aus Südost. Die Temperatur schafft höchstens 3 Grad.

In der Nacht ist zeitweise mit Regen, Schneeregen und gefrierendem Regen und damit auch Glatteis zu rechnen!

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Jederzeit kann es etwas regnen, oben im Wienerwald auch schneien. Außerdem besteht in der Früh Glatteisgefahr durch gefrierenden Regen! Zunächst überwiegen die Wolken. Am Nachmittag kommt vermehrt die Sonne zum Zug. Es bläst lebhafter, im Wienerwald auch starker Westwind. Die Temperatur erreicht bis zu 5 oder 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Wahlkampf in Ungarn: Magyar greift Orban scharf an
Story: Knapp zwei Monate vor der Parlamentswahl in Ungarn nimmt der Wahlkampf an Intensität zu. In einer Rede griff Oppositionsführer Peter Magyar den amtierenden Premier Viktor Orban am Sonntag scharf an. Orban sei nur zu „Hetze“ und „Drohungen“ fähig, nicht aber zur Auseinandersetzung mit den realen Problemen des Landes. Orban hatte Magyars Partei TISZA am Samstag als „Schöpfung“ des Auslands bezeichnet.

Jederzeit kann es etwas regnen, oben im Wienerwald auch schneien. Außerdem besteht in der Früh Glatteisgefahr durch gefrierenden Regen! Zunächst überwiegen die Wolken. Am Nachmittag kommt vermehrt die Sonne zum Zug. Es bläst lebhafter, im Wienerwald auch starker Westwind. Die Temperatur erreicht bis zu 5 oder 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Wahlkampf in Ungarn: Magyar greift Orban scharf an
Story: Knapp zwei Monate vor der Parlamentswahl in Ungarn nimmt der Wahlkampf an Intensität zu. In einer Rede griff Oppositionsführer Peter Magyar den amtierenden Premier Viktor Orban am Sonntag scharf an. Orban sei nur zu „Hetze“ und „Drohungen“ fähig, nicht aber zur Auseinandersetzung mit den realen Problemen des Landes. Orban hatte Magyars Partei TISZA am Samstag als „Schöpfung“ des Auslands bezeichnet.

Der Abend verläuft meist klar und vorerst auch noch sehr windig. Im Lauf der Nacht gibt es immer weniger Wind, allerdings auch langsam wieder Wolken. Es wird im gesamten Stadtgebiet frostig. Die Temperatur sinkt auf minus 3 bis minus 7 Grad.

Morgen, Montag

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch. Dazwischen zeigt sich die Sonne. Auch einzelne Schnee-, Regen- oder Graupelschauer können dabei sein. Es weht mäßiger bis lebhafter Wind meist aus Südost. Die Temperatur schafft höchstens 3 Grad.

In der Nacht ist zeitweise mit Regen, Schneeregen und gefrierendem Regen und damit auch Glatteis zu rechnen!

Übermorgen, Dienstag

Jederzeit kann es etwas regnen, oben im Wienerwald auch schneien. Außerdem besteht in der Früh Glatteisgefahr durch gefrierenden Regen! Zunächst überwiegen die Wolken. Am Nachmittag kommt vermehrt die Sonne zum Zug. Es bläst lebhafter, im Wienerwald auch starker Westwind. Die Temperatur erreicht bis zu 5 oder 6 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Mittwoch anfangs noch stark bewölkt und eventuell ein kurzer Schneeschauer mit böigem Westwind, rasch aber trocken und zeitweise sonnig. Im Laufe des Tages nur langsam nachlassender Wind und neuerlich bis zu 6 Grad.

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

Headline: Wahlkampf in Ungarn: Magyar greift Orban scharf an
Story: Knapp zwei Monate vor der Parlamentswahl in Ungarn nimmt der Wahlkampf an Intensität zu. In einer Rede griff Oppositionsführer Peter Magyar den amtierenden Premier Viktor Orban am Sonntag scharf an. Orban sei nur zu „Hetze“ und „Drohungen“ fähig, nicht aber zur Auseinandersetzung mit den realen Problemen des Landes. Orban hatte Magyars Partei TISZA am Samstag als „Schöpfung“ des Auslands bezeichnet.

Headline: Rubio: USA wollen Europa nicht als "Vasallen"
Story: US-Außenminister Marco Rubio ist heute in Bratislava mit dem slowakischen Regierungschef Robert Fico zusammengetroffen. Er betonte dabei das Interesse Washingtons an einem unabhängigen Europa als Partner der USA. "Wir verlangen von Europa nicht, ein Vasall der Vereinigten Staaten zu sein."
Die US-Regierung wolle "kein abhängiges Europa", sondern einen "Partner". "Wir wollen mit unseren Verbündeten zusammenarbeiten", fügte Rubio hinzu. Er erklärte zudem, dass die USA keine Pläne hätten, aus der NATO auszutreten.Bei der zivilen Nutzung der Atomenergie wollen die USA und die Slowakei künftig enger kooperieren. Im kommenden Jahr sollen laufende Gespräche mit der US-Firma Westinghouse über den Bau eines fünften Atomreaktors in Jaslovske Bohunice in eine konkrete Vertragsunterzeichnung münden, sagten Fico und Rubio.
Beim Thema Energie warnte Fico davor, dass die Ukraine Ungarn mit der ausbleibenden Reparatur der "Druschba"-Ölpipeline, die russisches Öl durch die Ukraine nach Ungarn und in die Slowakei transportiert, unter Druck setzen könne. Nach Bratislava ging es für Rubio nach Budapest weiter, wo er morgen mit Premier Viktor Orban zusammentrifft.

Headline: Trump: "Friedensrat" sagte fünf Mrd. für Gaza-Hilfe zu
Story: US-Präsident Donald Trump will in der nächsten Woche mit seinem initiierten "Friedensrat" ein Milliardenpaket an humanitärer und Wiederaufbauhilfe für den Gazastreifen vorstellen. Mitgliedsstaaten hätten mehr als fünf Milliarden Dollar (4,2 Mrd. Euro) zugesagt, schrieb der Republikaner heute auf der Plattform Truth Social.Zudem stelle man Tausende Einsatzkräfte bereit, die die lokale Polizei unterstützen und in der Region für Stabilisierung sorgen sollen. Der im Jänner von Trump gegründete "Friedensrat", der von Kritikerinnen und Kritikern als Konkurrenz zu den von Trump kritisierten Vereinten Nationen wahrgenommen wird, kommt nächste Woche in Washington zusammen. Der US-Präsident hat den Vorsitz inne.Trump forderte zudem neuerlich eine Entwaffnung der Terrororganisation Hamas. Hamas-Vertreter erteilten der im US-Friedensplan für den Gazastreifen verankerten Forderung nach einer Entwaffnung bereits mehrfach eine Absage.

Story: US-Außenminister Marco Rubio hat sich hinter die Erkenntnisse fünf europäischer Staaten gestellt, die Russland für den Giftmord am Kreml-Kritiker Alexej Nawalny verantwortlich machen. Die Regierung in Washington habe keinen Grund, den Bericht infrage zu stellen, sagte Rubio heute und bezeichnete das Papier als "besorgniserregend".Deutschland, Frankreich, Großbritannien, Schweden und die Niederlande hatten gestern am Rande der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz eine gemeinsame Erklärung veröffentlicht. Darin heißt es, Wissenschaftler hätten "schlüssig" den Giftstoff Epibatidin in Proben des Leichnams von Nawalny nachgewiesen. Das hochgiftige Sekret kommt in der Natur in südamerikanischen Pfeilgiftfröschen vor."Wir kennen den Bericht natürlich", sagte Rubio auf einer Pressekonferenz.

Headline: Kopftuchverbot: Kritik an Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft
Story: Über eine Woche nachdem die Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft zusammen mit anderen Akteuren der Zivilgesellschaft das geplante Kopftuchverbot kritisiert hat, kommt Kritik an der besagten Pressekonferenz auf. Grund ist die Teilnahme einer Organisation, die angeblich vom Dokumentationsarchiv des Österreichischen Widerstandes (DÖW) als antisemitisch eingestufte werde. Das hinterfragten mehrere politische Player und forderten Aufklärung.ÖVP-Integrationsministerin Claudia Bauer (ehemals Plakolm) kam in der "Kronen Zeitung" von heute zu Wort. "Als staatliche Organisation, wie die Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft eine ist, hat man eine höhere Verantwortung zu prüfen, mit wem man gemeinsame Sache macht. Das ist im Fall der Pressekonferenz nicht passiert oder man hat es billigend in Kauf genommen", wird sie in der Zeitung zitiert.Auch der Präsident der Israelitischen Kultusgemeinde für Salzburg, Steiermark und Kärnten, Elie Rosen, zeigte sich in einer Aussendung besorgt. Die Salzburger Landeshauptfrau-Stellvertreterin Marlene Svazek (FPÖ) fordertr "vollständige Aufklärung" wie es zu dem gemeinsamen Auftritt kam und welche Konsequenzen gezogen würden.Das Kopftuchverbot an Schulen für unter-14-Jährige bedrohe grundlegende Rechte, wie das Recht auf Religionsfreiheit, Selbstbestimmung und Bildung und verstoße gegen das Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, hatte es bei der Pressekonferenz am 6. Februar geheißen. Am Freitag gab es zudem eine Protestkundgebung in Wien gegen das Kopftuchverbot.Die APA konnte die Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft bisher nicht für eine Stellungnahme erreichen.

Headline: Kopftuchverbot: Kritik an Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft
Story: Über eine Woche nachdem die Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft zusammen mit anderen Akteuren der Zivilgesellschaft das geplante Kopftuchverbot kritisiert hat, kommt Kritik an der besagten Pressekonferenz auf. Grund ist die Teilnahme einer Organisation, die angeblich vom Dokumentationsarchiv des Österreichischen Widerstandes (DÖW) als antisemitisch eingestufte werde. Das hinterfragten mehrere politische Player und forderten Aufklärung.ÖVP-Integrationsministerin Claudia Bauer (ehemals Plakolm) kam in der "Kronen Zeitung" von heute zu Wort. "Als staatliche Organisation, wie die Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft eine ist, hat man eine höhere Verantwortung zu prüfen, mit wem man gemeinsame Sache macht. Das ist im Fall der Pressekonferenz nicht passiert oder man hat es billigend in Kauf genommen", wird sie in der Zeitung zitiert.Auch der Präsident der Israelitischen Kultusgemeinde für Salzburg, Steiermark und Kärnten, Elie Rosen, zeigte sich in einer Aussendung besorgt. Die Salzburger Landeshauptfrau-Stellvertreterin Marlene Svazek (FPÖ) fordertr "vollständige Aufklärung" wie es zu dem gemeinsamen Auftritt kam und welche Konsequenzen gezogen würden.Das Kopftuchverbot an Schulen für unter-14-Jährige bedrohe grundlegende Rechte, wie das Recht auf Religionsfreiheit, Selbstbestimmung und Bildung und verstoße gegen das Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, hatte es bei der Pressekonferenz am 6. Februar geheißen. Am Freitag gab es zudem eine Protestkundgebung in Wien gegen das Kopftuchverbot.Die APA konnte die Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft bisher nicht für eine Stellungnahme erreichen.

Heute, Montag

Immer wieder ziehen Wolken durch. Dazwischen zeigt sich die Sonne. Auch einzelne Schnee-, Regen- oder Graupelschauer können dabei sein. Es weht mäßiger bis lebhafter Wind meist aus Südost. Die Temperatur schafft höchstens um 4 Grad.

In der Nacht ist zeitweise mit Regen, Schneeregen und gefrierendem Regen und damit auch Glatteis zu rechnen!

Morgen, Dienstag

Jederzeit kann es etwas regnen, im Wienerwald auch schneien. Zunächst überwiegen die Wolken, am Nachmittag kommt vermehrt die Sonne zum Zug. Es bläst mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind. Die Temperatur erreicht bis zu 5 oder 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Wolken und Sonnenschein wechseln, die sonnigen Phasen werden zum Abend hin länger. Kurz kann es ein wenig regnen oder in der Früh unergiebig schneien, die meiste Zeit bleibt es trocken. Anfangs weht lebhafter Westwind, im Tagesverlauf wird der Wind schwächer. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 5 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag mit auffrischendem Nordwind wieder kälter, dazu überwiegend stark bewölkt, aber weitgehend trocken. Kaum mehr als 2 Grad am Nachmittag.

Am Freitag aus heutiger Sicht trocken und meist sonnig, dazu zeitweise lebhafter Nordwestwind und eine höchste Temperatur um 3 Grad.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: USA: Midterms werfen ihren Schatten voraus
Story: In weniger als neun Monaten wird bei den Midterms in den USA über die Mehrheiten im Repräsentantenhaus und im Senat entschieden. In Umfragen stehen die Republikaner derzeit weniger gut da. US-Präsident Donald Trump versucht schon vorab mit zum Teil verfassungswidrigen Vorschlägen, Wahlabläufe zu beeinflussen. Zunächst müssen auch noch parteiinterne Wahlen geschlagen werden. Unter großer Beobachtung beginnt am Dienstag in Texas die vorgezogene Stimmabgabe für die Vorwahl des republikanischen Senatskandidaten aus diesem Bundesstaat.

Headline: USA: Midterms werfen ihren Schatten voraus
Story: In weniger als neun Monaten wird bei den Midterms in den USA über die Mehrheiten im Repräsentantenhaus und im Senat entschieden. In Umfragen stehen die Republikaner derzeit weniger gut da. US-Präsident Donald Trump versucht schon vorab mit zum Teil verfassungswidrigen Vorschlägen, Wahlabläufe zu beeinflussen. Zunächst müssen auch noch parteiinterne Wahlen geschlagen werden. Unter großer Beobachtung beginnt am Dienstag in Texas die vorgezogene Stimmabgabe für die Vorwahl des republikanischen Senatskandidaten aus diesem Bundesstaat.

Headline: Replik auf US-Kritik: "Europa steht nicht vor Untergang"
Story: Die dreitägige Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz (MSC) ist am Sonntag zu Ende gegangen. MSC-Leiter Wolfgang Ischinger sagte in seiner Abschlussrede, bei dem Treffen sei ein „größerer Geist der europäischen Entschlossenheit“ zu spüren gewesen, die gemeinsamen Werte zu verteidigen. Das hatte zuvor auch EU-Außenbeauftragte Kaja Kallas betont und Kritik von Vertretern der US-Regierung zurückgewiesen: „Anders als manche meinen, steht das woke, dekadente Europa nicht vor dem Untergang seiner Zivilisation.“

Headline: Großdemos für Präsident Pavel in Tschechien
Story: Tausende Menschen sind gestern in mehr als 400 Städten und Gemeinden Tschechiens auf die Straße gegangen, um sich demonstrativ hinter den liberalen Präsidenten Petr Pavel zu stellen.Wie die Nachrichtenagentur CTK berichtete, folgten sie einem Aufruf der Initiative "Millionen Augenblicke für Demokratie", das Staatsoberhaupt in einem Streit mit der rechtspopulistischen Regierung zu unterstützen.
Bereits am 1. Februar hatten sich in der Hauptstadt Prag nach Angaben der Organisatoren bereits bis zu 90.000 Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer zu einer Kundgebung mit demselben Ziel versammelt. Für 21. März will dieselbe Protestinitiative eine Massenkundgebung auf dem Letna-Hügel in Prag organisieren.In Tschechiens zweitgrößter Stadt Brno kamen nach CTK-Informationen 8.000 bis 10.000 Menschen zusammen, in manchen kleineren Orten waren es wenige hundert.Pavel hatte Ende Jänner erklärt, Außenminister Petr Macinka, der zugleich Parteichef der mitregierenden Autofahrerpartei Motoristen ist, versuche, ihn zu erpressen. Die Motoristen verlangen einen Ministerposten für ihren Ehrenvorsitzenden Filip Turek. Dieser soll sich in der Vergangenheit rassistisch und sexistisch geäußert haben, weshalb ihn Pavel ablehnt.

Headline: Feller muss es im Slalom für alle richten
Story: Mögliches Motto: „Jetzt oder nie.“ Nach Silber in der Teamkombi mit Vincent Kriechmayr soll es Manuel Feller am Montag (10.00 bzw. 13.30 Uhr, live in ORF1 und im Livestream) in Bormio auch im Slalom für alle  richten und im letzten  Olympiabewerb für die erste Einzel-Medaille der ÖSV-Herren sorgen, am besten in Gold. Der Druck ist gewachsen und weckt Erinnerungen an die prekäre Situation Marcel Hirschers bei der Heim-WM 2013 in Schladming.

Headline: Attentat auf Bondi Beach: Angreifer erstmals vor Gericht
Story: Der mutmaßliche Täter des antisemitischen Schusswaffenangriffs am australischen Bondi Beach ist heute (Ortszeit) per Videoübertragung zu seiner ersten öffentlichen Anhörung vor einem Gericht in Sydney erschienen.Der wegen Terrorismus und 15-fachen Mordes angeklagte Naveed Akram erschien für etwa fünf Minuten und sprach kaum während der Anhörung, wie australische Medien berichteten. Es sei bei dem Gerichtstermin überwiegend um technische Fragen gegangen.15 Menschen getötetAm 14. Dezember hatten Naveed Akram und sein Vater Sajid Akram während einer Zeremonie zum Chanukkafest am Bondi Beach in Sydney in die Menge geschossen. 15 Menschen wurden getötet, dutzende weitere wurden verletzt. Die australischen Behörden stufen die Tat als antisemitischen Angriff ein.Sie gehen davon aus, dass die beiden Täter von der Ideologie der Dschihadistenmiliz Islamischer Staat (IS) beeinflusst waren. Der 50-jährige Sajid Akram wurde von der Polizei erschossen.Vor dem Gericht sagte Naveed Akrams Anwalt Ben Archbold, sein Mandant werde unter "sehr beschwerlichen Bedingungen" festgehalten, wie der australische Sender ABC berichtete. Er sagte zudem, es sei noch zu früh, um zu sagen, ob Naveed Akram sich schuldig bekennen würde.

Headline: F: Angst vor Racheakten nach Tötung von Rechtsextremem
Story: Der gewaltsame Tod eines Rechtsextremen in Lyon hat Befürchtungen vor möglichen Racheakten geschürt. Frankreichs Staatschef Emmanuel Macron rief zu "Ruhe, Zurückhaltung und Respekt" auf. In Frankreich könne "keine Ideologie jemals rechtfertigen, dass man tötet". Justizminister Gerald Darmanin beschuldigte gestern die "extreme Linke", für die Tat verantwortlich zu sein.
Der 23-Jährige war am Donnerstag am Rande von Protesten gegen einen Auftritt der linksgerichteten Europaabgeordneten Rima Hassan in Lyon angegriffen worden. Der Student und Angehörige der rechtsextremen Identitären starb zwei Tage später im Spital.Die Behörden ermitteln. Der 23-Jährige war Teil des Ordnungsdienstes der Gegendemonstrantinnen und -demonstranten. Ein französischer TV-Sender zeigte ein Video des Angriffs. Auf den Aufnahmen ist zu sehen, wie drei Männer von einer Gruppe von Angreifern zusammengeschlagen werden. Der Anwalt der Familie des Getöteten sprach von einem "Hinterhalt". Die Familie rief zu "Ruhe und Zurückhaltung" auf.Justizminister kritisiert MelenchonJustizminister Darmanin sagte, er beobachte Reden der extremen Linken, insbesondere von der linkspopulistischen Partei La France Insoumise (LFI), "die leider zu ungezügelter Gewalt in Onlinediensten und dann in der physischen Welt führen". Die Politikerin Hassan und LFI-Chef Jean-Luc Melenchon hätten zudem "nicht ein Wort an die Familie des jungen Mannes" gerichtet.Melenchon selbst äußerte seine "Bestürzung" über die Tat. "Wir sprechen seiner Familie und seinen Angehörigen unser Mitgefühl und unsere Anteilnahme aus", sagte er. Seine Partei lehne jegliche Gewalt ab, die gegen ihn erhobenen Vorwürfe seien "realitätsfern".

Headline: Drohnenabwehr: "Schreckliche" Resultate bei NATO-Übung
Story: Recherchen des "Wall Street Journal" zeigen Schwächen bei der Abwehr von Drohnen durch NATO-Bodentruppen auf. Wie das Blatt berichtete, hätte im Vorjahr bei einer Bündnisübung ein Team von etwa zehn eingeladenen Ukrainern innerhalb kürzester Zeit zahlreiche gepanzerte Fahrzeuge und andere Ziele ausgeschaltet.Ein Übungsteilnehmer sagte dem Blatt, die von Esten geführte gegnerische Einheit mit den Ukrainern habe "zwei Bataillone an einem Tag" kampfunfähig gemacht. Der NATO-Seite sei es nicht gelungen, die gegnerischen Drohnenteams auszuschalten. Für sie seien die Resultate "schrecklich" gewesen.An der Übung "Hedgehog 2025" nahmen nach Angaben der estnischen Streitkräfte insgesamt mehr als 16.000 Armeeangehörige aus rund einem Dutzend NATO-Staaten teil. Ein Bataillon besteht in der Regel aus einigen hundert bis etwa 1.000 Soldaten. Die Ukrainer waren als Gäste und Experten für Drohnenkampf eingeladen.Die NATO äußerte sich nicht zu Details der Übung. Eine Sprecherin wies allerdings darauf hin, dass Übungsszenarien gezielt so angelegt werden können, dass die gegnerische Seite im Vorteil ist. "Wir üben, um zu trainieren und zu lernen, damit wir auf Herausforderungen in der realen Welt vorbereitet sind", sagte sie der Nachrichtenagentur dpa. Beim Thema Drohnen teile die Ukraine ihre umfangreichen Erfahrungen mit ihren Partnern in der NATO.

Headline: Versprechen für Schulen: Kritik von Lehrergewerkschaft
Story: Bildungsminister Christoph Wiederkehr (NEOS) hat den Schulen weniger Bürokratie und mehr Unterstützung durch Deutschförderkräfte, Schulpsychologie und -sozialarbeit versprochen.  In der Praxis ist davon laut dem obersten Lehrervertreter Paul Kimberger (FCG) noch nicht viel bemerkbar. Der Minister zeige sich engagiert, aber auf "seine Verheißungen wie eine Entbürokratisierung warten die Schulen noch."Gestrichene Erlässe teils wieder in KraftZwar wurden mit Beginn des aktuellen Schuljahrs 80 Prozent der Ministeriumserlässe gestrichen. "Mir hat aber noch keine Schule berichtet, dass dadurch eine Entlastung entstanden wäre – im Gegenteil", so Kimberger im Gespräch mit der APA.Bei einem Teil der Erlässe und Rundschreiben habe man festgestellt, dass sie doch gebraucht werden und das Ministerium habe sie nach langen Diskussionen wieder in Kraft gesetzt. Als Beispiel nannte er den Aufsichtserlass mit der genauen Ausgestaltung der Aufsichtspflicht.Zu viel Aufwand, zu wenig neues PersonalEbenfalls "mit Vorsicht zu genießen" sei die Ankündigung von zusätzlichem Personal, das die Schulen entlasten soll. Auch die Ankündigung, den Schulen bei der Deutschförderung wieder mehr Autonomie zu geben und die Verpflichtung zu separaten Deutschförderklassen abzuschaffen, ist für Kimberger keine Verbesserung.Denn: Schulen, die in Zukunft die Deutschförderung wieder nach ihren eigenen Vorstellungen organisieren wollen, müssen dafür dem Ministerium bis April ein Sprachförderkonzept vorlegen. Viele Schulen hätten den Aufwand dafür kritisiert und würden stattdessen bei Förderklassen und -kursen bleiben.Man spüre zudem, dass angesichts der Budgetkonsolidierung mit weniger Posten bei den neuen pädagogisch-administrativen Fachkräften gestartet wurde. Von 190 Stellen im Postenplan sei derzeit nur ein Drittel besetzt. In der Schulpsychologie und -sozialarbeit seien zwar zusätzliche Posten ausgeschrieben, Kimberger habe aber "noch keinen zusätzlichen Schulpsychologen getroffen".

Headline: Karner antwortet auf Ludwig-Kritik zu Familiennachzug
Story: Die Neuaufstellung des Familiennachzugs von Asylberechtigten sorgt für Verstimmungen zwischen Bund und Ländern. Wiens Bürgermeister Michael Ludwig (SPÖ) hat in einem Schreiben an Innenminister Gerhard Karner (ÖVP) den Konsultationsmechanismus ausgelöst, weil er Mehrkosten für die Stadt befürchtet.Der Innenminister hat nun geantwortet und betont, dass man den Ländern ohnehin schon entgegengekommen sei. Allerdings sagt Karner eine weitere Prüfung zu.Länder sollen teilweise zuständig seinGrundlage der Diskussion ist die nationale Umsetzung des gemeinsamen europäischen Asylsystems, auf die sich die Regierung bei ihrer jüngsten Klausur verständigt hat. Im Zuge der Begutachtung kam es zu Kritik der Länder, weil die Behandlung der Anträge auf Familiennachzug teilweise von den Bundes- auf Landesbehörden übergehen soll.Ludwig schätzt den jährlichen Mehraufwand für die Stadt auf 2,4 Mio. Euro. Die – der APA vorliegende – Antwort des Innenministers zieht diese Zahlen in Zweifel, umso mehr, als Karner sinkende Verfahrenszahlen erwartet.Künftig ist vorgesehen, dass der (aktuell überhaupt pausierte) Familiennachzug aller Personengruppen über die Niederlassungsverordnung geregelt wird. Der Familiennachzug von Asylberechtigten soll über Kontingente geregelt werden. Das Ministerium sieht vor, dass Verlängerungsanträge hier künftig von den Landesbehörden zu behandeln sind, Erstanträge blieben beim Bundesamt für Asyl- und Fremdenwesen.Karner weist Kritik zurückKarner verweist nun darauf, dass ursprünglich geplant gewesen sei, dass alle Anträge in die Länderkompetenz fallen. Der vorgenommene Kompromiss bei den Erstanträgen bringe schon eine "systemfremde Zuständigkeit" des BFA. Gesprächsbereit zeigt sich der Minister dennoch. Ludwigs Brief werde zum Anlass genommen, "die vorgeschlagenen Regelungen erneut zu prüfen".

Headline: F: Anklage nach versuchtem Angriff auf Chef von Kryptobörse
Story: Drei Männer sind in Frankreich wegen eines versuchten Überfalls auf den Chef des Kryptowährung-Unternehmens Binance France angeklagt worden.Sie seien am Donnerstag mit Handfeuerwaffen und maskiert in die Wohnung eines Paares in Saint-Mande bei Paris eingedrungen und hätten die Bewohner gefangen gehalten und misshandelt, wie die Staatsanwaltschaft der Nachrichtenagentur AFP gestern mitteilte. Die Täter hätten "offenkundig den Chef von Binance France" gesucht.Weitere Familie attackiertDie Männer begaben sich im Anschluss nach Angaben der Staatsanwaltschaft rund 20 Kilometer weiter und attackierten dort eine andere Familie. Eine Frau wurde demnach mehrmals mit dem Griff einer Waffe geschlagen. Während des Überfalls hörten die Opfer, wie einer der Täter am Telefon sagte, die Adresse sei "nicht die richtige".Serie an ÜberfällenSeit Anfang des vergangenen Jahres hatte es in Frankreich mehrere Überfälle auf Menschen mit Verbindungen zu Kryptowährung-Unternehmen gegeben. Im Januar war der Mitgründer des Unternehmens Ledger, das Krypto-Wallets vertreibt, zusammen mit seiner Partnerin entführt worden.Im Mai wurde mitten in Paris der Vater eines Mannes, der mit Kryptowährungen viel verdient hatte, ebenfalls von maskierten Männern entführt, als er mit seinem Hund spazieren ging. In beiden Fällen trennten die Entführer ihren Opfern einen Finger ab, um ihren Forderungen nach Lösegeld Nachdruck zu verleihen.

Headline: Warner erwägt erneute Gespräche mit Paramount
Story: Der von Netflix umworbene Medienkonzern Warner Bros Discovery liebäugelt einem Medienbericht zufolge nun doch wieder mit dem konkurrierenden Übernahmeangebot von Paramount Skydance.Nachdem Warner zuletzt Netflix als Käufer bevorzugt hatte, berieten Mitglieder des Warner-Verwaltungsrats nun über das nachgebesserte Angebot von Paramount, berichtete Bloomberg gestern unter Berufung auf mit der Angelegenheit vertraute Personen.Eine Entscheidung sei allerdings noch nicht gefallen. Reuters erhielt von den drei Unternehmen zunächst keine Stellungnahmen zu dem Bericht.Bewertung um rund 108 Mrd. DollarParamount hatte sein Offert zuletzt nachgebessert. Zwar blieb der Preis von 30 Dollar (25,29 Euro) pro Aktie unverändert, doch lockt der Konzern nun mit einer zusätzlichen Verzögerungsprämie: Warner-Aktionäre sollen 25 Cent je Anteilsschein für jedes Quartal ab 2027 erhalten, in dem die Transaktion noch nicht abgeschlossen ist.Zudem erklärte sich der CBS-Eigner bereit, die Vertragsstrafe von 2,8 Mrd. Dollar (2,4 Mrd. Euro) zu übernehmen, die Warner bei einem Platzen des Netflix-Deals zahlen müsste. Das Angebot bewertet Warner inklusive Schulden mit 108,4 Mrd. Dollar.Wertvolle MarkenUm den Medienriesen tobt ein erbitterter Bieterkampf. Sowohl der Streaming-Marktführer Netflix als auch Paramount wollen sich den Zugriff auf die renommierten Film- und Fernsehstudios sowie lukrative Marken wie "Game of Thrones", "Harry Potter" und die DC-Comics-Reihe um Batman und Superman sichern.

Headline: OpenAI rekrutiert OpenClaw-Entwickler Steinberger
Story: Der Oberösterreicher Peter Steinberger, der in den letzten Wochen mit seinem KI-Programm OpenClaw weltweit für Aufsehen gesorgt hat, wechselt zum KI-Konzern OpenAI. Das kündigte gestern sowohl OpenAI-Chef Sam Altman auf X als auch Steinberger selbst auf seiner Website an.Steinberger solle die Entwicklung der nächsten Generation persönlicher Agenten "vorantreiben", so Altman. Steinberger erklärte er in Silicon-Valley-typischer Manier frank und frei zum "Genie mit vielen erstaunlichen Ideen".Altman hofft auf EinnahmequelleAltman, der angesichts der unzähligen Milliarden, die Investoren seit Monaten in seine Firma stecken, rasch einträgliche Geschäftmodelle für seine Algorithmen braucht, zeigte sich überzeugt, dass persönliche Agenten "schnell zu einem Kernstück unseres Produktangebots werden" würden.OpenClaw werde als Open-Source-Projekt in einer Stiftung weiterleben, die OpenAI unterstützen werde, so Altman weiter. Auch OpenAI war zu Beginn als Stiftung geführt worden.Steinberger will "Teil der Spitze" seinSteinberger schrieb in einem separaten Beitrag auf seiner Website, dass er zu OpenAI wechsle, um "Teil der Spitze der KI-Forschung und -Entwicklung zu sein".Er habe sich durchaus vorstellen können, dass OpenClaw "zu einem riesigen Unternehmen" hätte werden können. Jedoch habe er bereits ein Unternehmen gegründet, "13 Jahre meines Lebens darin investiert und viel gelernt". Nun wolle er die Welt verändern, anstatt "ein großes Unternehmen aufzubauen, und die Zusammenarbeit mit OpenAI ist der schnellste Weg, dies für alle zu erreichen".Steinberger will "die Welt verändern"Steinberger meinte auf seiner Website, der letzte Monat sei ein einziger Trubel gewesen. Er habe nie erwartet, dass sein "Spielplatzprojekt" – gemeint: OpenClaw – solche Wellen schlagen würde. Zahlreiche Möglichkeiten hätten sich für ihn aufgetan. Tatsächlich sollen auch Meta und Anthropic um Steinberger geworben haben.

Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

Headline: Hommage an Lula: Debatte über unerlaubte Wahlwerbung in Rio
Story: Die brasilianische Präsidentschaftswahl im Oktober wirft bereits jetzt ihre Schatten voraus. Mit einer Hommage an Präsident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva löste eine Sambaschule beim Karneval in Rio de Janeiro am Sonntagabend (Ortszeit) eine Debatte über vorgezogene und damit mutmaßlich illegale Wahlwerbung los. Bereits vor der Parade gab es Kritik an der Aktion. Lula will im Oktober für eine vierte Amtszeit kandidieren.

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Headline: F: Ermittlungen nach Tötung von Rechtsextremem
Story: Nach dem gewaltsamen Tod eines jungen Rechtsextremen in der französischen Stadt Lyon hat die Staatsanwaltschaft Ermittlungen wegen vorsätzlicher Tötung eingeleitet. Der 23-Jährige sei an den Folgen einer schweren Hirnverletzung gestorben, nachdem er von "mindestens sechs" Verdächtigen angegriffen worden sei, sagte Staatsanwalt Thierry Dran heute. Der Fall werde als "vorsätzliche Tötung" und "schwere Körperverletzung" untersucht.Bisher keine FestnahmenBisher seien noch keine Festnahmen erfolgt. Die Behörden arbeiteten daran, die Identität der maskierten und vermummten Verdächtigen festzustellen. Es seien "mehr als 15 Zeugen" vernommen worden, zudem würden derzeit Videos des Übergriffs ausgewertet.
Der Staatsanwalt sagte, der Getötete habe "vor allem Kopfverletzungen" aufgewiesen, darunter "ein schweres Schädelhirntrauma", das "innerhalb kurzer Zeit" zum Tod führte. Messerstiche seien entgegen ersten Informationen aus Ermittlerkreisen nicht vorgelegen.23-Jähriger starb im SpitalDer 23-Jährige war am Donnerstag am Rande von Protesten gegen einen Auftritt der linksgerichteten Europaabgeordneten Rima Hassan in Lyon attackiert worden. Der Student und Angehörige der rechtsextremen Identitären erlag am Samstag in einem Spital seinen schweren Verletzungen.Justizminister: "Extreme Linke" für Tat verantwortlichJustizminister Gerald Darmanin beschuldigte die "extreme Linke", für die Tat verantwortlich zu sein. Der Anwalt der Familie sprach von einem "Hinterhalt", der "methodisch vorbereitet" worden sei. Die Familie des Toten rief zu "Ruhe und Zurückhaltung" auf.Die Politikerin Hassan und LFI-Chef Jean-Luc Melenchon hätten zudem "nicht ein Wort an die Familie des jungen Mannes" gerichtet, sagte Darmanin. Melenchon selbst äußerte seine "Bestürzung" über die Tat. "Wir sprechen seiner Familie und seinen Angehörigen unser Mitgefühl und unsere Anteilnahme aus", sagte er. Seine Partei lehne jegliche Gewalt ab, die gegen ihn erhobenen Vorwürfe seien "realitätsfern".

Headline: F: Ermittlungen nach Tötung von Rechtsextremem
Story: Nach dem gewaltsamen Tod eines jungen Rechtsextremen in der französischen Stadt Lyon hat die Staatsanwaltschaft Ermittlungen wegen vorsätzlicher Tötung eingeleitet. Der 23-Jährige sei an den Folgen einer schweren Hirnverletzung gestorben, nachdem er von "mindestens sechs" Verdächtigen angegriffen worden sei, sagte Staatsanwalt Thierry Dran heute. Der Fall werde als "vorsätzliche Tötung" und "schwere Körperverletzung" untersucht.Bisher keine FestnahmenBisher seien noch keine Festnahmen erfolgt. Die Behörden arbeiteten daran, die Identität der maskierten und vermummten Verdächtigen festzustellen. Es seien "mehr als 15 Zeugen" vernommen worden, zudem würden derzeit Videos des Übergriffs ausgewertet.
Der Staatsanwalt sagte, der Getötete habe "vor allem Kopfverletzungen" aufgewiesen, darunter "ein schweres Schädelhirntrauma", das "innerhalb kurzer Zeit" zum Tod führte. Messerstiche seien entgegen ersten Informationen aus Ermittlerkreisen nicht vorgelegen.23-Jähriger starb im SpitalDer 23-Jährige war am Donnerstag am Rande von Protesten gegen einen Auftritt der linksgerichteten Europaabgeordneten Rima Hassan in Lyon attackiert worden. Der Student und Angehörige der rechtsextremen Identitären erlag am Samstag in einem Spital seinen schweren Verletzungen.Justizminister: "Extreme Linke" für Tat verantwortlichJustizminister Gerald Darmanin beschuldigte die "extreme Linke", für die Tat verantwortlich zu sein. Der Anwalt der Familie sprach von einem "Hinterhalt", der "methodisch vorbereitet" worden sei. Die Familie des Toten rief zu "Ruhe und Zurückhaltung" auf.Die Politikerin Hassan und LFI-Chef Jean-Luc Melenchon hätten zudem "nicht ein Wort an die Familie des jungen Mannes" gerichtet, sagte Darmanin. Melenchon selbst äußerte seine "Bestürzung" über die Tat. "Wir sprechen seiner Familie und seinen Angehörigen unser Mitgefühl und unsere Anteilnahme aus", sagte er. Seine Partei lehne jegliche Gewalt ab, die gegen ihn erhobenen Vorwürfe seien "realitätsfern".

Headline: Polens Präsident für eigenes Atomwaffenprogramm
Story: Polens Präsident Karol Nawrocki sieht sein Land von Russland bedroht und hat sich deshalb für ein eigenes Atomwaffenprogramm ausgesprochen. "Der Weg zu einem polnischen Atompotenzial – bei allem Respekt für internationale Regelungen – ist der Weg, den wir gehen sollten", sagte der rechtskonservative Staatschef heute dem Fernsehsender Polsatnews.Polen sei ein Land direkt an der Grenze zu einem bewaffneten Konflikt, betonte Nawrocki mit Blick auf den Ukraine-Krieg. "Wir wissen, welche aggressive und imperiale Haltung Russland zu Polen hat." Daher sei er dafür, die Sicherheit seines Landes mit einem Atomwaffenprogramm zu erhöhen.Wann das begonnen werde, könne er allerdings nicht sagen. Auf die Frage, ob er keine Reaktion Russlands auf diesen Schritt fürchte, entgegnete Nawrocki: "Russland kann auf alles aggressiv reagieren.""Sensibelste aller sensiblen Themen"Verteidigungsminister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz reagierte auf den Vorstoß des Präsidenten, der in Polen auch Oberbefehlshaber der Armee ist, verhalten.Die Frage von Atomwaffen sei "das sensibelste aller sensiblen Themen", sagte der Minister laut Nachrichtenagentur PAP. Auch er sei zwar für die Schaffung eigener Forschungs- und Entwicklungskapazitäten, es sei aber besser, mehr zu tun, als über Pläne und Absichten zu sprechen.

Headline: Pilnacek-U-Ausschuss: Karner kritisiert Ladungsliste
Story: Innenminister Gerhard Karner (ÖVP) hat heute am Rande einer Pressekonferenz in St. Pölten scharfe Kritik an der neuen Ladungsliste des Untersuchungsausschusses zu den Ermittlungen im Fall Christian Pilnacek geübt.Von 25 Personen seien 15 Polizeibeamte, neun von diesen wiederum Mitarbeiter des Landeskriminalamts Niederösterreich. Karner sprach von einer "Hetz- und Treibjagd" der FPÖ und ihrer Handlanger auf rechtschaffene Polizistinnen und Polizisten. Das gelte vor allem dafür, dass Menschen, "die Verbrecher jagen", geladen und förmlich "in diesen Untersuchungsausschuss gejagt" würden.Es liege in der Natur der Sache, dass hier auch Polizisten als Auskunftspersonen geladen würden, entgegnete FPÖ-Generalsekretär und -Fraktionsführer im Ausschuss, Christian Hafenecker."Die Angst vor der Aufklärung im Pilnacek-Untersuchungsausschuss lässt bei der ÖVP und ihrem Innenminister Karner offenbar die Nerven bereits so blank liegen, dass sie dieses wichtige parlamentarische Aufklärungsgremium nicht nur von vorne bis hinten sabotieren, sondern jetzt auch noch mit unterirdischer Wortwahl beschimpfen", so Hafenecker per Aussendung.

Story: Innenminister Gerhard Karner (ÖVP) hat heute am Rande einer Pressekonferenz in St. Pölten scharfe Kritik an der neuen Ladungsliste des Untersuchungsausschusses zu den Ermittlungen im Fall Christian Pilnacek geübt.Von 25 Personen seien 15 Polizeibeamte, neun von diesen wiederum Mitarbeiter des Landeskriminalamts Niederösterreich. Karner sprach von einer "Hetz- und Treibjagd" der FPÖ und ihrer Handlanger auf rechtschaffene Polizistinnen und Polizisten. Das gelte vor allem dafür, dass Menschen, "die Verbrecher jagen", geladen und förmlich "in diesen Untersuchungsausschuss gejagt" würden.Es liege in der Natur der Sache, dass hier auch Polizisten als Auskunftspersonen geladen würden, entgegnete FPÖ-Generalsekretär und -Fraktionsführer im Ausschuss, Christian Hafenecker."Die Angst vor der Aufklärung im Pilnacek-Untersuchungsausschuss lässt bei der ÖVP und ihrem Innenminister Karner offenbar die Nerven bereits so blank liegen, dass sie dieses wichtige parlamentarische Aufklärungsgremium nicht nur von vorne bis hinten sabotieren, sondern jetzt auch noch mit unterirdischer Wortwahl beschimpfen", so Hafenecker per Aussendung.

Current weather for Vienna: Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Headline: Pilnacek-U-Ausschuss: Karner kritisiert Ladungsliste
Story: Innenminister Gerhard Karner (ÖVP) hat heute am Rande einer Pressekonferenz in St. Pölten scharfe Kritik an der neuen Ladungsliste des Untersuchungsausschusses zu den Ermittlungen im Fall Christian Pilnacek geübt.Von 25 Personen seien 15 Polizeibeamte, neun von diesen wiederum Mitarbeiter des Landeskriminalamts Niederösterreich. Karner sprach von einer "Hetz- und Treibjagd" der FPÖ und ihrer Handlanger auf rechtschaffene Polizistinnen und Polizisten. Das gelte vor allem dafür, dass Menschen, "die Verbrecher jagen", geladen und förmlich "in diesen Untersuchungsausschuss gejagt" würden.Es liege in der Natur der Sache, dass hier auch Polizisten als Auskunftspersonen geladen würden, entgegnete FPÖ-Generalsekretär und -Fraktionsführer im Ausschuss, Christian Hafenecker."Die Angst vor der Aufklärung im Pilnacek-Untersuchungsausschuss lässt bei der ÖVP und ihrem Innenminister Karner offenbar die Nerven bereits so blank liegen, dass sie dieses wichtige parlamentarische Aufklärungsgremium nicht nur von vorne bis hinten sabotieren, sondern jetzt auch noch mit unterirdischer Wortwahl beschimpfen", so Hafenecker per Aussendung.

Headline: Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe zurück
Story: Die Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft hat den Vorwurf, mit antisemitischen Organisationen zu kooperieren, entschieden zurückgewiesen. In einer Aussendung reagierte sie heute auf Kritik an einer Pressekonferenz Anfang Februar."Keine der Personen beziehungsweise Organisationen, die im Rahmen der Pressekonferenz inhaltlich gesprochen haben", würden als antisemitisch eingestuft, hieß es. Mit anderen Personen, die an Ort und Stelle waren, bestünde keine Zusammenarbeit.Die Kritik – unter anderen von ÖVP-Integrationsministerin Claudia Bauer (ehemals Plakolm) – drehte sich vor allem um die Person von Irina Vana. Sie war bei besagter Pressekonferenz dabei und tritt etwa bei der Liste Gaza sowie der Antiimperialistischen Koordination (AIK) auf.Vana habe bei der Veranstaltung lediglich moderiert und nicht inhaltlich gesprochen, hieß es aus der Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft. Sie sei kurzfristig eingesprungen, man habe sie davor nicht gekannt. Die Planung sei zudem von anderen Organisationen ausgegangen, wurde gegenüber der APA betont."Höhere Verantwortung" bei staatlicher OrganisationDas Büro Bauer ortete einen bedenklichen Umgang mit einer problematischen Organisation. Die AIK zeige antisemitische Tendenzen, hieß es mit Verweis auf Berichte aus dem Umfeld des Dokumentationsarchivs des Österreichischen Widerstandes (DÖW)."Als staatliche Organisation, wie die Gleichbehandlungsanwaltschaft eine ist, hat man eine höhere Verantwortung zu prüfen, mit wem man gemeinsame Sache macht", hatte die Ministerin zur "Krone" gesagt.Auch der Präsident der Israelitischen Kultusgemeinde (IKG) für Salzburg, Steiermark und Kärnten, Elie Rosen, und die Salzburger Landeshauptfrau-Stellvertreterin Marlene Svazek (FPÖ) zeigten sich besorgt.

Headline: Krankenkassen rechnen für 2025 mit 511 Mio. Verlust
Story: Das Minus bei den Krankenkassen fällt im abgelaufenen Jahr laut den vorläufigen Zahlen des Dachverbands der Sozialversicherungsträger etwas besser aus als noch im November erwartet.Laut der heute veröffentlichten Gebarungsvorschau für Februar liegt der Bilanzverlust 2025 bei 511,2 Millionen Euro.  Im November war man noch von einem Defizit von 583,3 Mio. Euro ausgegangen.
Die Österreichischen Gesundheitskasse (ÖGK) als größter der drei gesetzlichen Krankenversicherungsträger erwartet 2025 ein Minus von 454 Mio. Euro. Im ÖGK-Jahresvoranschlag war noch ein Defizit von 906 Mio. Euro eingepreist worden, in der November-Gebarung ging man dann von minus 546,6 Mio. aus.Auch die Prognose für das laufende Jahr fällt mit minus 431 Mio. Euro bei der ÖGK leicht besser aus als in der letzten Gebarungsvorschau im November angenommen (460 Mio. Euro). Die Aufwendungen der ÖGK lagen 2025 bei 21,4 Milliarden Euro, heuer werden sie laut Prognose auf 22,56 Mrd. Euro ansteigen."Erste Wirkung"Der ÖGK zufolge zeigen die eingeleiteten Konsolidierungsmaßnahmen "erste Wirkung". Dennoch wachse aber der strukturelle Finanzierungsbedarf durch Rezession, demografischen Wandel und medizinischen Fortschritt weiter, hieß es.Die ÖGK rechnet dabei 2026 mit einem Minus von rund 431 Mio. Euro, 2027 von 687 Mio. Euro und 2028 von 948 Mio. Euro. Bei der Versicherungsanstalt öffentlich Bediensteter, Eisenbahnen und Bergbau (BVAEB), die 2025 einen Verlust von 127,4 Mio. erwartet, geht das Minus heuer auf 124 Mio. und 2027 auf 117 Mio. zurück. 2028 steigt es dann laut Prognose auf 174 Mio. Euro.Durchwegs positiv bilanziert die Sozialversicherungsanstalt der Selbständigen (SVS). Laut vorläufigen Zahlen macht der Gewinn 2025 70,2 Mio. Euro aus, um dann im laufenden Jahr auf 124 Mio. Euro anzuwachsen. 2027 rechnet die SVS mit einem Plus von 91 Mio., 2028 von 64 Mio. Euro.

Current weather for Vienna: Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: FBI sperrt Beweismittel zu ICE-Schüssen auf US-Bürger
Story: Nach den tödlichen Schüssen auf den US-Bürger Alex Pretti, abgegeben von Beamten der US-Einwanderungsbehörde ICE, werfen die Behörden in Minnesota der Bundespolizei mangelnde Zusammenarbeit vor. Das FBI teile weder Beweismittel noch gesammelte Informationen, teilte die Strafverfolgungsbehörde des Bundesstaats (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, BCA) heute mit.Das Vorgehen sei besorgniserregend und beispiellos. ICE-Beamte hatten Pretti im Jänner in Minneapolis erschossen. Sie waren mit Tausenden anderen ICE-Beamtinnen und -Beamten von der Regierung von US-Präsident Donald Trump in die Stadt und den Bundesstaat Minnesota im Norden der USA geschickt worden, um mit Razzien gegen Migrantinnen und Migranten vorzugehen.Bereits Anfang Jänner hatte ein Bundesbeamter in Minneapolis die US-Bürgerin Renee Good erschossen. Die Vorfälle hatten große Empörung in den USA ausgelöst.

Current weather for Vienna: Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

Headline: Epstein-Akten: Razzia an Pariser Institut du Monde Arabe
Story: Im Zuge der im Fall Epstein eingeleiteten Ermittlungen gegen Frankreichs früheren Kulturminister Jack Lang hat die Finanzstaatsanwaltschaft Durchsuchungen angeordnet.Unter anderem werde das Pariser Kulturinstitut Institut du Monde Arabe (IMA) durchsucht, als dessen Präsident Lang nach Start der Ermittlungen zurückgetreten war, teilte die Staatsanwaltschaft heute mit.Gegen Lang (86) und seine Tochter Caroline Lang wird wegen des Verdachts auf Geldwäsche und schweren Steuerbetrug ermittelt. Die beiden Namen tauchten zuvor in den Dokumenten auf, die von der US-Justiz im Rahmen der Affäre um den US-Multimillionär und Sexualstraftäter Jeffrey Epstein veröffentlicht wurden.Die Ermittlungen betreffen nach Angaben der Staatsanwaltschaft mutmaßliche finanzielle Verbindungen der beiden zu Epstein. Dabei soll es laut Medienberichten um eine von Epstein gegründete Gesellschaft mit Sitz in einem Steuerparadies gehen, an der Caroline Lang die Hälfte der Anteile gehalten habe.Jack Lang wies entsprechende Vorwürfe als unbegründet zurück und berief sich bisher auf seine "Naivität" mit Blick auf die Beziehung zu Epstein. Unter dem Druck der Vorwürfe bot er dennoch seinen Rücktritt als Präsident des IMA an.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: Epstein-Akten: Razzia an Pariser Institut du Monde Arabe
Story: Im Zuge der im Fall Epstein eingeleiteten Ermittlungen gegen Frankreichs früheren Kulturminister Jack Lang hat die Finanzstaatsanwaltschaft Durchsuchungen angeordnet.Unter anderem werde das Pariser Kulturinstitut Institut du Monde Arabe (IMA) durchsucht, als dessen Präsident Lang nach Start der Ermittlungen zurückgetreten war, teilte die Staatsanwaltschaft heute mit.Gegen Lang (86) und seine Tochter Caroline Lang wird wegen des Verdachts auf Geldwäsche und schweren Steuerbetrug ermittelt. Die beiden Namen tauchten zuvor in den Dokumenten auf, die von der US-Justiz im Rahmen der Affäre um den US-Multimillionär und Sexualstraftäter Jeffrey Epstein veröffentlicht wurden.Die Ermittlungen betreffen nach Angaben der Staatsanwaltschaft mutmaßliche finanzielle Verbindungen der beiden zu Epstein. Dabei soll es laut Medienberichten um eine von Epstein gegründete Gesellschaft mit Sitz in einem Steuerparadies gehen, an der Caroline Lang die Hälfte der Anteile gehalten habe.Jack Lang wies entsprechende Vorwürfe als unbegründet zurück und berief sich bisher auf seine "Naivität" mit Blick auf die Beziehung zu Epstein. Unter dem Druck der Vorwürfe bot er dennoch seinen Rücktritt als Präsident des IMA an.

Current weather for Vienna: Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

Headline: Selenskyj warnt vor umfassendem russischem Luftangriff
Story: Kurz vor Beginn einer neuen Gesprächsrunde mit Russland hat der ukrainische Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj heute vor einem umfassenden russischen Angriff auf Energieanlagen in der Ukraine gewarnt."Russland kann der Versuchung nicht widerstehen und möchte in den letzten Tagen der Winterkälte den Ukrainern einen schmerzhaften Schlag zufügen", sagte Selenskyj in einer Videobotschaft. Die ukrainische Delegation sei bereits am Verhandlungsort Genf in der Schweiz eingetroffen.Der Ukrainer warf Moskau erneut vor, im Gegensatz zu Kiew nicht zu Kompromissen bereit zu sein. "Russland verwirft alles, setzt die Sturmangriffe an der Front und die Luftschläge auf unsere Städte und die Energieversorgung fort", so Selenskyj. Russland müsse zum Frieden unter anderem mit neuen Sanktionen gezwungen werden.Schnellere NachschublieferungenDie westlichen Verbündeten bat er um rechtzeitige Lieferungen von Flugabwehrmitteln. "Es ist notwendig, dass das, worüber wir in München mit den Partnern gesprochen haben, zeitnah umgesetzt wird", hob der Staatschef hervor. Ein Lieferverzug vergrößere nur die von den Angriffen verursachten Schäden.Seit dem Herbst hat Russland Angriffe mit Kampfdrohnen und Raketen auf ukrainische Energieanlagen intensiviert. In einem der härtesten Winter seit Jahren leiden Millionen Ukrainer und Ukrainerinnen unter Strom-, Heizungs- und Wasserausfällen.

Headline: Selenskyj warnt vor umfassendem russischem Luftangriff
Story: Kurz vor Beginn einer neuen Gesprächsrunde mit Russland hat der ukrainische Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj heute vor einem umfassenden russischen Angriff auf Energieanlagen in der Ukraine gewarnt."Russland kann der Versuchung nicht widerstehen und möchte in den letzten Tagen der Winterkälte den Ukrainern einen schmerzhaften Schlag zufügen", sagte Selenskyj in einer Videobotschaft. Die ukrainische Delegation sei bereits am Verhandlungsort Genf in der Schweiz eingetroffen.Der Ukrainer warf Moskau erneut vor, im Gegensatz zu Kiew nicht zu Kompromissen bereit zu sein. "Russland verwirft alles, setzt die Sturmangriffe an der Front und die Luftschläge auf unsere Städte und die Energieversorgung fort", so Selenskyj. Russland müsse zum Frieden unter anderem mit neuen Sanktionen gezwungen werden.Schnellere NachschublieferungenDie westlichen Verbündeten bat er um rechtzeitige Lieferungen von Flugabwehrmitteln. "Es ist notwendig, dass das, worüber wir in München mit den Partnern gesprochen haben, zeitnah umgesetzt wird", hob der Staatschef hervor. Ein Lieferverzug vergrößere nur die von den Angriffen verursachten Schäden.Seit dem Herbst hat Russland Angriffe mit Kampfdrohnen und Raketen auf ukrainische Energieanlagen intensiviert. In einem der härtesten Winter seit Jahren leiden Millionen Ukrainer und Ukrainerinnen unter Strom-, Heizungs- und Wasserausfällen.

Headline: Trump-"Friedensrat": Kommissarin Suica reist nach Washington
Story: Die EU-Kommission entsendet nach eigenen Angaben ein Mitglied zur Sitzung des von US-Präsident Donald Trump gegründeten "Friedensrates". Mittelmeer-Kommissarin Dubravka Suica werde "später diese Woche" nach Washington reisen, um der Sitzung zum Gazastreifen beizuwohnen, sagte ein Kommissionssprecher heute in Brüssel. Die EU-Kommission sei aber "kein Mitglied des ‚Friedensrates‘".Trump hatte das Gremium im Jänner als Konkurrenz zu den Vereinten Nationen auf dem Weltwirtschaftsforum in Davos gegründet. 19 Länder unterzeichneten die Gründungscharta. Mehrere eingeladene Staaten nahmen nicht daran teil. Österreichs Bundeskanzler Christian Stocker (ÖVP) hatte Ende Jänner erklärt, die Einladung werde geprüft.Am Donnerstag soll die erste Sitzung stattfinden. Laut der Charta des Rates entscheidet Trump allein über die Mitglieder und hat bei allen Entscheidungen ein Vetorecht. Ein ständiger Sitz im Rat kostet rund eine Milliarde Dollar.

Current weather for Vienna: Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

NEWS DEEP DIVE: Please present the following news story to the listeners in your own words.

Headline: Bericht: VW plant neue Einsparungen in Höhe von 60 Mrd.
Story: Der VW-Konzern plant einem Bericht zufolge ein neues Sparprogramm mit einem Volumen von rund 60 Milliarden Euro. Laut "Manager Magazin" sollen die Kosten bis 2028 um 20 Prozent sinken, wie das Blatt heute unter Berufung auf interne Informationen berichtete. So komme man auf den genannten Betrag.Grund für den Schritt seien die schleppenden Verkäufe in China und die US-Zölle. Daher reichten die bisherigen Sparbemühungen nicht aus, hieß es. Werksschließungen könnten nicht ausgeschlossen werden, ebenso wenig ein weiterer Stellenabbau über die bereits angekündigten 35.000 Stellen hinaus. Details nannte das Blatt nicht.VW reagierte zurückhaltend und verwies auf die bereits laufenden Sparprogramme bei allen Marken. Einen Zwischenstand werde Konzernchef Oliver Blume am 10. März bei der Jahrespressekonferenz geben. Betriebsratschefin Daniela Cavallo sprach sich erneut klar gegen Standortschließungen aus.

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

Headline: Hundert US-Soldaten in Nigeria eingetroffen
Story: Die USA weiten ihren Militäreinsatz gegen Islamisten in Nigeria aus. Es seien etwa einhundert US-Soldaten eingetroffen, um die örtlichen Streitkräfte auszubilden und zu beraten, sagte ein Sprecher des Verteidigungsministeriums heute. Sie würden sich nicht an Kampfhandlungen beteiligen.Von der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters ausgewerteten Flugdaten zufolge steuerten in den vergangenen Tagen mehrere Maschinen mit Soldaten und Ausrüstung den Norden des Landes an.Nigeria weist Trumps Vorwurf zurückUS-Präsident Donald Trump hatte der Regierung in der Hauptstadt Abuja vorgeworfen, Christen im Nordwesten nicht ausreichend vor militanten Islamisten zu schützen. Nigeria weist den Vorwurf der religiösen Diskriminierung zurück.Die Sicherheitskräfte gehen nach Darstellung der Regierung gegen alle bewaffneten Gruppen vor, die sowohl Christen als auch Muslime angreifen. Dennoch benötige das Land "große Unterstützung der US-Regierung" in Form von Kampfjets und Munition, sagte Präsidialsprecher Sunday Dare. Einzelheiten nannte er nicht.Luftattacken gegen IS-VerbündeteBisher unterstützte ein kleines US-Team die nigerianische Armee bei der Aufklärung. Im Dezember hatten die USA zudem Luftangriffe gegen mutmaßliche Verbündete der Miliz Islamischer Staat (IS) geflogen.Nigeria mit seinen rund 240 Millionen Einwohnern und Einwohnerinnen ist religiös in einen mehrheitlich muslimischen Norden und einen vorwiegend christlichen Süden gespalten. Die US-Soldaten treffen inmitten schwerer Kämpfe im Nordosten des Landes ein.Am Wochenende wehrten Regierungstruppen nach eigenen Angaben koordinierte Angriffe der Islamistengruppen Boko Haram und ISWAP auf zwei Militärstützpunkte im Bundesstaat Borno ab. Dabei seien mehrere Soldaten getötet worden, hieß es. Das waren einige der heftigsten Gefechte in diesem Jahr. Borno gilt als das Zentrum des seit 17 Jahren andauernden Aufstands der Islamisten.

Headline: Nach Kritik: Zwei ÖJC-Vorstände müssen gehen
Story: Der Österreichische Journalisten Club (ÖJC) hat nach kritischen Medienberichten und "massiven Imageproblemen" gestern zu einer Generalversammlung geladen. Das Ergebnis laut heutiger Aussendung: Zwei umstrittene Personen sind nicht länger Teil des Vorstands. Dieter Reinisch wurde aus dem Vorstand abgewählt, John Herzog aus dem Verein ausgeschlossen.Reinisch arbeitet aus Österreich u. a. für den staatlichen iranischen Sender Press TV. Seine Abwahl erfolgte "wegen Beschädigung des Vereinsinteresses". In den Statuten des ÖJC verankerte Ziele sind etwa, sich für Grund- und Freiheitsrechte, die Pressefreiheit und die Wahrung des Redaktionsgeheimnisses einzusetzen.Im Falle von Herzog ortete der Club "zunehmend am Vorstand vorbei durchgeführte Aktivitäten". Auch soll er für einen "vermehrten chinesischen Einfluss im ÖJC" gesorgt haben. Er wurde nach einer Debatte bei der außerordentlichen Generalversammlung aus dem ÖJC ausgeschlossen. Präsident des Vereins ist weiterhin Christian Stöger.Debatte über Preisgeld im Jahr 2019Der ÖJC stand schon 2019 unter Kritik, weil er Sponsoren des damals verliehenen Claus-Gatterer-Preises ein Vielfaches des Preisgeldes in Rechnung gestellt haben soll. Bisherige Preisträger forderten daraufhin den Rückzug des ÖJC als Organisator der Auszeichnung.Der ÖJC wies die Vorwürfe zurück und hielt an der Vergabe fest, vergab aber kein Preisgeld mehr. Ab 2021 vergab der Presseclub Concordia die neue mit 10.000 Euro dotierte "Auszeichnung für hervorragenden Journalismus im Gedenken an Claus Gatterer".

Headline: ETH Zürich findet Sicherheitslücken bei Passwortmanagern
Story: Millionen von Menschen vertrauen beim Schutz sensibler Daten auf den Dienst eines Passwortmanagers. Hersteller versprechen, dass die abgelegten Passwörter sicher verschlüsselt sind. Zweifel daran kommen heutigen Angaben zufolge von einem Forschungsteam der ETH Zürich.Diese konnte eigenen Angaben zufolge Angriffe auf die Passwortmanager dreier populärer Anbieter demonstrieren. "Wir waren überrascht, wie groß die Sicherheitslücken sind", sagte Kenneth Paterson, Informatikprofessor an der ETH Zürich.Das Forschungsteam gab den betroffenen Anbietern der gehackten Systeme 90 Tage Zeit, die Sicherheitslücken zu schließen. Dabei hätten sich die Hersteller kooperativ gezeigt, wobei beim Beheben der Sicherheitslücken nicht alle gleich schnell gewesen seien.

Headline: "Teheran"-Produzentin Dana Eden in Athen tot aufgefunden
Story: Die Produzentin der erfolgreichen israelischen Fernsehserie "Teheran", Dana Eden, ist in einem Hotelzimmer in Athen tot aufgefunden worden. Die 52-jährige Eden hielt sich seit dem 4. Februar in Athen auf, wo gerade die vierte Staffel der im Streamingdienst Apple TV laufenden Spionageserie gedreht wird.
Edens Leiche wurde den Angaben zufolge gestern Abend in ihrem Zimmer in einem Hotel in der Nähe des Syntagma-Platzes im Zentrum der griechischen Hauptstadt entdeckt. Die Polizei habe eine Autopsie angeordnet und Aufnahmen von Überwachungskameras ausgewertet, sagte der Sprecher. Nach ersten Erkenntnissen sei den Polizeiangaben zufolge von einem Suizid auszugehen."Teheran" handelt von einer Mossad-Agentin, die vom israelischen Geheimdienst in die iranische Hauptstadt geschickt wird. Sie ist eine der international erfolgreichsten israelischen Serien. 2021 wurde sie bei der Verleihung der US-Fernsehpreise mit dem Emmy für die beste Dramaserie ausgezeichnet. Auch die ersten drei Staffeln der Serie waren in Athen gedreht worden.Hilfe im KrisenfallBerichte über (mögliche) Suizide können bei Personen, die sich in einer Krise befinden, die Situation verschlimmern. Österreichweit und in den Bundesländern gibt es Anlaufstellen, die Rat und Unterstützung im Krisenfall anbieten.

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

Current weather forecast for Vienna:
Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

It's time for a weather update! Please present the full weather forecast to the listeners in your own words, then suggest and introduce a song that fits the current weather mood.

Current weather for Vienna: Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.

Current weather for Vienna: Heute Abend, heute Nacht

Am Abend gibt es hin und wieder freie Sicht auf Mond und Sterne. Dann zieht es zu und ab Mitternacht schneit es wieder ein bisschen. Auch gefrierender Regen ist in manchen Bezirken möglich. Zur Früh hin kommt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Tiefstwerte liegen meist bei minus 2 bis 0 Grad.

Morgen, Dienstag

Wechselhaft und windig. Anfangs kann es vor allem nach Osten zu durch gefrierenden Regen glatt sein. Dann fallen nur noch vereinzelt Regentropfen oder in höheren Lagen Schneeflocken. Es wechseln bewölkte und sonnige Abschnitte. Nach und nach kommt in der ganzen Stadt mäßiger bis lebhafter Westwind auf. Die Temperatur steigt auf 4 bis 6 Grad.

Übermorgen, Mittwoch

Oft sonnig und sehr windig. In Summe gehen sich ein paar Sonnenstunden aus. Lebhafter bis kräftiger Westwind treibt zwar wiederholt Wolken durch, die meiste Zeit bleibt es aber trocken. Die höchste Temperatur liegt um 7 Grad.

Der weitere Trend

Am Donnerstag bewölkt und im Tagesverlauf einsetzender Regen oder Schneeregen, zum Abend hin wahrscheinlich vermehrt Schneefall. Höchstwert noch unsicher, zwischen 3 und bis zu 9 Grad möglich.

Am Freitag mit einströmender Kaltluft zunehmend sonnig, zeitweise sogar wolkenloser Himmel. Dazu kräftiger und eiskalter Nordwestwind. Die höchste Temperatur: um oder knapp über 0 Grad.

Am Samstag nach einem sonnigen Start voraussichtlich vermehrt Wolken und später am Tag Schneefall oder Regen möglich. Meist mäßiger Südostwind und ein Höchstwert zwischen 1 und 5 Grad.

Am Sonntag wahrscheinlich unbeständig und mit starkem Westwind deutlich milder als an den Tagen zuvor, eine Höchsttemperatur um 10 Grad. Regenschauer nicht ausgeschlossen.
